 chapter 1 peter breaks through 

 all children , except one , grow up . they soon know that they will grow 
 up , and the way wendy knew was this . one day when she was two years old 
 she was playing in a garden , and she plucked another flower and ran with 
 it to her mother . i suppose she must have looked rather delightful , for 
 mrs. darling put her hand to her heart and cried , “ oh , why ca n't you 
 remain like this for ever ! ” this was all that passed between them on 
 the subject , but henceforth wendy knew that she must grow up . you always 
 know after you are two . two is the beginning of the end . 

 of course they lived at 14 [ their house number on their street ] , and 
 until wendy came her mother was the chief one . she was a lovely lady , 
 with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth . her romantic 
 mind was like the tiny boxes , one within the other , that come from the 
 puzzling east , however many you discover there is always one more ; and 
 her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that wendy could never get , 
 though there it was , perfectly conspicuous in the right - hand corner . 

 the way mr. darling won her was this : the many gentlemen who had been 
 boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her , 
 and they all ran to her house to propose to her except mr. darling , who 
 took a cab and nipped in first , and so he got her . he got all of her , 
 except the innermost box and the kiss . he never knew about the box , and 
 in time he gave up trying for the kiss . wendy thought napoleon could 
 have got it , but i can picture him trying , and then going off in a 
 passion , slamming the door . 

 mr. darling used to boast to wendy that her mother not only loved him 
 but respected him . he was one of those deep ones who know about stocks 
 and shares . of course no one really knows , but he quite seemed to know , 
 and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that 
 would have made any woman respect him . 

 mrs. darling was married in white , and at first she kept the books 
 perfectly , almost gleefully , as if it were a game , not so much as a 
 brussels sprout was missing ; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped 
 out , and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces . 
 she drew them when she should have been totting up . they were mrs. 
 darling 's guesses . 

 wendy came first , then john , then michael . 

 for a week or two after wendy came it was doubtful whether they would 
 be able to keep her , as she was another mouth to feed . mr. darling was 
 frightfully proud of her , but he was very honourable , and he sat on the 
 edge of mrs. darling 's bed , holding her hand and calculating expenses , 
 while she looked at him imploringly . she wanted to risk it , come what 
 might , but that was not his way ; his way was with a pencil and a piece 
 of paper , and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at 
 the beginning again . 

 “ now do n't interrupt , ” he would beg of her . 

 “ i have one pound seventeen here , and two and six at the office ; i can 
 cut off my coffee at the office , say ten shillings , making two nine 
 and six , with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven , with five 
 naught naught in my cheque - book makes eight nine seven -- who is that 
 moving ?-- eight nine seven , dot and carry seven -- don't speak , my own -- and 
 the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet , child -- dot 
 and carry child -- there , you 've done it!--did i say nine nine seven ? yes , 
 i said nine nine seven ; the question is , can we try it for a year on 
 nine nine seven ? ” 

 “ of course we can , george , ” she cried . but she was prejudiced in wendy 's 
 favour , and he was really the grander character of the two . 

 “ remember mumps , ” he warned her almost threateningly , and off he went 
 again . “ mumps one pound , that is what i have put down , but i daresay 
 it will be more like thirty shillings -- don't speak -- measles one five , 
 german measles half a guinea , makes two fifteen six -- don't waggle your 
 finger -- whooping - cough , say fifteen shillings”--and so on it went , and 
 it added up differently each time ; but at last wendy just got through , 
 with mumps reduced to twelve six , and the two kinds of measles treated 
 as one . 

 there was the same excitement over john , and michael had even a narrower 
 squeak ; but both were kept , and soon , you might have seen the three of 
 them going in a row to miss fulsom 's kindergarten school , accompanied by 
 their nurse . 

 mrs. darling loved to have everything just so , and mr. darling had a 
 passion for being exactly like his neighbours ; so , of course , they had 
 a nurse . as they were poor , owing to the amount of milk the children 
 drank , this nurse was a prim newfoundland dog , called nana , who had 
 belonged to no one in particular until the darlings engaged her . she had 
 always thought children important , however , and the darlings had become 
 acquainted with her in kensington gardens , where she spent most of her 
 spare time peeping into perambulators , and was much hated by careless 
 nursemaids , whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their 
 mistresses . she proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse . how thorough 
 she was at bath - time , and up at any moment of the night if one of her 
 charges made the slightest cry . of course her kennel was in the nursery . 
 she had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience 
 with and when it needs stocking around your throat . she believed to her 
 last day in old - fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf , and made sounds of 
 contempt over all this new - fangled talk about germs , and so on . it was a 
 lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school , walking 
 sedately by their side when they were well behaved , and butting them 
 back into line if they strayed . on john 's footer [ in england soccer 
 was called football , “ footer ” for short ] days she never once forgot his 
 sweater , and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of 
 rain . there is a room in the basement of miss fulsom 's school where the 
 nurses wait . they sat on forms , while nana lay on the floor , but that 
 was the only difference . they affected to ignore her as of an inferior 
 social status to themselves , and she despised their light talk . she 
 resented visits to the nursery from mrs. darling 's friends , but if they 
 did come she first whipped off michael 's pinafore and put him into the 
 one with blue braiding , and smoothed out wendy and made a dash at john 's 
 hair . 

 no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly , and 
 mr. darling knew it , yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the 
 neighbours talked . 

 he had his position in the city to consider . 

 nana also troubled him in another way . he had sometimes a feeling that 
 she did not admire him . “ i know she admires you tremendously , george , ” 
  mrs. darling would assure him , and then she would sign to the children 
 to be specially nice to father . lovely dances followed , in which the 
 only other servant , liza , was sometimes allowed to join . such a midget 
 she looked in her long skirt and maid 's cap , though she had sworn , when 
 engaged , that she would never see ten again . the gaiety of those romps ! 
 and gayest of all was mrs. darling , who would pirouette so wildly that 
 all you could see of her was the kiss , and then if you had dashed at her 
 you might have got it . there never was a simpler happier family until 
 the coming of peter pan . 

 mrs. darling first heard of peter when she was tidying up her children 's 
 minds . it is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children 
 are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next 
 morning , repacking into their proper places the many articles that have 
 wandered during the day . if you could keep awake ( but of course you 
 ca n't ) you would see your own mother doing this , and you would find it 
 very interesting to watch her . it is quite like tidying up drawers . you 
 would see her on her knees , i expect , lingering humorously over some of 
 your contents , wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up , 
 making discoveries sweet and not so sweet , pressing this to her cheek as 
 if it were as nice as a kitten , and hurriedly stowing that out of sight . 
 when you wake in the morning , the naughtiness and evil passions with 
 which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom 
 of your mind and on the top , beautifully aired , are spread out your 
 prettier thoughts , ready for you to put on . 

 i do n't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person 's mind . 
 doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you , and your own map can 
 become intensely interesting , but catch them trying to draw a map of a 
 child 's mind , which is not only confused , but keeps going round all 
 the time . there are zigzag lines on it , just like your temperature on a 
 card , and these are probably roads in the island , for the neverland is 
 always more or less an island , with astonishing splashes of colour here 
 and there , and coral reefs and rakish - looking craft in the offing , and 
 savages and lonely lairs , and gnomes who are mostly tailors , and caves 
 through which a river runs , and princes with six elder brothers , and a 
 hut fast going to decay , and one very small old lady with a hooked nose . 
 it would be an easy map if that were all , but there is also first day 
 at school , religion , fathers , the round pond , needle - work , murders , 
 hangings , verbs that take the dative , chocolate pudding day , getting 
 into braces , say ninety - nine , three - pence for pulling out your tooth 
 yourself , and so on , and either these are part of the island or they are 
 another map showing through , and it is all rather confusing , especially 
 as nothing will stand still . 

 of course the neverlands vary a good deal . john 's , for instance , had a 
 lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which john was shooting , while 
 michael , who was very small , had a flamingo with lagoons flying over 
 it . john lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands , michael in 
 a wigwam , wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together . john had no 
 friends , michael had friends at night , wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by 
 its parents , but on the whole the neverlands have a family resemblance , 
 and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have 
 each other 's nose , and so forth . on these magic shores children at play 
 are for ever beaching their coracles [ simple boat ] . we too have been 
 there ; we can still hear the sound of the surf , though we shall land no 
 more . 

 of all delectable islands the neverland is the snuggest and most 
 compact , not large and sprawly , you know , with tedious distances between 
 one adventure and another , but nicely crammed . when you play at it by 
 day with the chairs and table - cloth , it is not in the least alarming , 
 but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real . that 
 is why there are night - lights . 

 occasionally in her travels through her children 's minds mrs. darling 
 found things she could not understand , and of these quite the most 
 perplexing was the word peter . she knew of no peter , and yet he was 
 here and there in john and michael 's minds , while wendy 's began to be 
 scrawled all over with him . the name stood out in bolder letters than 
 any of the other words , and as mrs. darling gazed she felt that it had 
 an oddly cocky appearance . 

 “ yes , he is rather cocky , ” wendy admitted with regret . her mother had 
 been questioning her . 

 “ but who is he , my pet ? ” 

 “ he is peter pan , you know , mother . ” 

 at first mrs. darling did not know , but after thinking back into her 
 childhood she just remembered a peter pan who was said to live with the 
 fairies . there were odd stories about him , as that when children died he 
 went part of the way with them , so that they should not be frightened . 
 she had believed in him at the time , but now that she was married and 
 full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person . 

 “ besides , ” she said to wendy , “ he would be grown up by this time . ” 

 “ oh no , he is n't grown up , ” wendy assured her confidently , “ and he is 
 just my size . ” she meant that he was her size in both mind and body ; she 
 did n't know how she knew , she just knew it . 

 mrs. darling consulted mr. darling , but he smiled pooh - pooh . “ mark my 
 words , ” he said , “ it is some nonsense nana has been putting into their 
 heads ; just the sort of idea a dog would have . leave it alone , and it 
 will blow over . ” 

 but it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave mrs. 
 darling quite a shock . 

 children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them . 
 for instance , they may remember to mention , a week after the event 
 happened , that when they were in the wood they had met their dead 
 father and had a game with him . it was in this casual way that wendy one 
 morning made a disquieting revelation . some leaves of a tree had been 
 found on the nursery floor , which certainly were not there when the 
 children went to bed , and mrs. darling was puzzling over them when wendy 
 said with a tolerant smile : 

 “ i do believe it is that peter again ! ” 

 “ whatever do you mean , wendy ? ” 

 “ it is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet , ” wendy said , sighing . she 
 was a tidy child . 

 she explained in quite a matter - of - fact way that she thought peter 
 sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her 
 bed and played on his pipes to her . unfortunately she never woke , so she 
 did n't know how she knew , she just knew . 

 “ what nonsense you talk , precious . no one can get into the house without 
 knocking . ” 

 “ i think he comes in by the window , ” she said . 

 “ my love , it is three floors up . ” 

 “ were not the leaves at the foot of the window , mother ? ” 

 it was quite true ; the leaves had been found very near the window . 

 mrs. darling did not know what to think , for it all seemed so natural to 
 wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming . 

 “ my child , ” the mother cried , “ why did you not tell me of this before ? ” 

 “ i forgot , ” said wendy lightly . she was in a hurry to get her breakfast . 

 oh , surely she must have been dreaming . 

 but , on the other hand , there were the leaves . mrs. darling examined 
 them very carefully ; they were skeleton leaves , but she was sure they 
 did not come from any tree that grew in england . she crawled about the 
 floor , peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot . she 
 rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls . she let down a 
 tape from the window to the pavement , and it was a sheer drop of thirty 
 feet , without so much as a spout to climb up by . 

 certainly wendy had been dreaming . 

 but wendy had not been dreaming , as the very next night showed , the 
 night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be 
 said to have begun . 

 on the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed . it 
 happened to be nana 's evening off , and mrs. darling had bathed them and 
 sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into 
 the land of sleep . 

 all were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and 
 sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew . 

 it was something for michael , who on his birthday was getting into 
 shirts . the fire was warm , however , and the nursery dimly lit by three 
 night - lights , and presently the sewing lay on mrs. darling 's lap . then 
 her head nodded , oh , so gracefully . she was asleep . look at the four of 
 them , wendy and michael over there , john here , and mrs. darling by the 
 fire . there should have been a fourth night - light . 

 while she slept she had a dream . she dreamt that the neverland had come 
 too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it . he did not 
 alarm her , for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many 
 women who have no children . perhaps he is to be found in the faces of 
 some mothers also . but in her dream he had rent the film that obscures 
 the neverland , and she saw wendy and john and michael peeping through 
 the gap . 

 the dream by itself would have been a trifle , but while she was dreaming 
 the window of the nursery blew open , and a boy did drop on the floor . 
 he was accompanied by a strange light , no bigger than your fist , which 
 darted about the room like a living thing and i think it must have been 
 this light that wakened mrs. darling . 

 she started up with a cry , and saw the boy , and somehow she knew at once 
 that he was peter pan . if you or i or wendy had been there we should 
 have seen that he was very like mrs. darling 's kiss . he was a lovely 
 boy , clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but 
 the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth . 
 when he saw she was a grown - up , he gnashed the little pearls at her . 




 chapter 2 the shadow 

 mrs. darling screamed , and , as if in answer to a bell , the door opened , 
 and nana entered , returned from her evening out . she growled and sprang 
 at the boy , who leapt lightly through the window . again mrs. darling 
 screamed , this time in distress for him , for she thought he was killed , 
 and she ran down into the street to look for his little body , but it 
 was not there ; and she looked up , and in the black night she could see 
 nothing but what she thought was a shooting star . 

 she returned to the nursery , and found nana with something in her mouth , 
 which proved to be the boy 's shadow . as he leapt at the window nana had 
 closed it quickly , too late to catch him , but his shadow had not had 
 time to get out ; slam went the window and snapped it off . 

 you may be sure mrs. darling examined the shadow carefully , but it was 
 quite the ordinary kind . 

 nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow . she 
 hung it out at the window , meaning “ he is sure to come back for it ; let 
 us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children . ” 

 but unfortunately mrs. darling could not leave it hanging out at the 
 window , it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the 
 house . she thought of showing it to mr. darling , but he was totting up 
 winter great - coats for john and michael , with a wet towel around his 
 head to keep his brain clear , and it seemed a shame to trouble him ; 
 besides , she knew exactly what he would say : “ it all comes of having a 
 dog for a nurse . ” 

 she decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer , 
 until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband . ah me ! 

 the opportunity came a week later , on that never - to - be - forgotten friday . 
 of course it was a friday . 

 “ i ought to have been specially careful on a friday , ” she used to say 
 afterwards to her husband , while perhaps nana was on the other side of 
 her , holding her hand . 

 “ no , no , ” mr. darling always said , “ i am responsible for it all . i , 
 george darling , did it . mea culpa , mea culpa . ” he had had a classical 
 education . 

 they sat thus night after night recalling that fatal friday , till every 
 detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other 
 side like the faces on a bad coinage . 

 “ if only i had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 , ” mrs. darling 
 said . 

 “ if only i had not poured my medicine into nana 's bowl , ” said mr. 
 darling . 

 “ if only i had pretended to like the medicine , ” was what nana 's wet eyes 
 said . 

 “ my liking for parties , george . ” 

 “ my fatal gift of humour , dearest . ” 

 “ my touchiness about trifles , dear master and mistress . ” 

 then one or more of them would break down altogether ; nana at the 
 thought , “ it 's true , it 's true , they ought not to have had a dog for 
 a nurse . ” many a time it was mr. darling who put the handkerchief to 
 nana 's eyes . 

 “ that fiend ! ” mr. darling would cry , and nana 's bark was the echo of 
 it , but mrs. darling never upbraided peter ; there was something in the 
 right - hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call peter names . 

 they would sit there in the empty nursery , recalling fondly every 
 smallest detail of that dreadful evening . it had begun so uneventfully , 
 so precisely like a hundred other evenings , with nana putting on the 
 water for michael 's bath and carrying him to it on her back . 

 “ i wo n't go to bed , ” he had shouted , like one who still believed that he 
 had the last word on the subject , “ i wo n't , i wo n't . nana , it is n't six 
 o'clock yet . oh dear , oh dear , i sha n't love you any more , nana . i tell 
 you i wo n't be bathed , i wo n't , i wo n't ! ” 

 then mrs. darling had come in , wearing her white evening - gown . she had 
 dressed early because wendy so loved to see her in her evening - gown , 
 with the necklace george had given her . she was wearing wendy 's bracelet 
 on her arm ; she had asked for the loan of it . wendy loved to lend her 
 bracelet to her mother . 

 she had found her two older children playing at being herself and father 
 on the occasion of wendy 's birth , and john was saying : 

 “ i am happy to inform you , mrs. darling , that you are now a mother , ” 
  in just such a tone as mr. darling himself may have used on the real 
 occasion . 

 wendy had danced with joy , just as the real mrs. darling must have done . 

 then john was born , with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the 
 birth of a male , and michael came from his bath to ask to be born also , 
 but john said brutally that they did not want any more . 

 michael had nearly cried . “ nobody wants me , ” he said , and of course the 
 lady in the evening - dress could not stand that . 

 “ i do , ” she said , “ i so want a third child . ” 

 “ boy or girl ? ” asked michael , not too hopefully . 

 “ boy . ” 

 then he had leapt into her arms . such a little thing for mr. and mrs. 
 darling and nana to recall now , but not so little if that was to be 
 michael 's last night in the nursery . 

 they go on with their recollections . 

 “ it was then that i rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? ” mr. darling 
 would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado . 

 perhaps there was some excuse for him . he , too , had been dressing for 
 the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie . it 
 is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew 
 about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie . sometimes the 
 thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it 
 would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and 
 used a made - up tie . 

 this was such an occasion . he came rushing into the nursery with the 
 crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand . 

 “ why , what is the matter , father dear ? ” 

 “ matter ! ” he yelled ; he really yelled . “ this tie , it will not tie . ” he 
 became dangerously sarcastic . “ not round my neck ! round the bed - post ! 
 oh yes , twenty times have i made it up round the bed - post , but round my 
 neck , no ! oh dear no ! begs to be excused ! ” 

 he thought mrs. darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on 
 sternly , “ i warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my 
 neck we do n't go out to dinner to - night , and if i do n't go out to dinner 
 to - night , i never go to the office again , and if i do n't go to the 
 office again , you and i starve , and our children will be flung into the 
 streets . ” 

 even then mrs. darling was placid . “ let me try , dear , ” she said , and 
 indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do , and with her nice 
 cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to 
 see their fate decided . some men would have resented her being able to 
 do it so easily , but mr. darling had far too fine a nature for that ; he 
 thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment 
 was dancing round the room with michael on his back . 

 “ how wildly we romped ! ” says mrs. darling now , recalling it . 

 “ our last romp ! ” mr. darling groaned . 

 “ o george , do you remember michael suddenly said to me , ' how did you get 
 to know me , mother ? ' ” 

 “ i remember ! ” 

 “ they were rather sweet , do n't you think , george ? ” 

 “ and they were ours , ours ! and now they are gone . ” 

 the romp had ended with the appearance of nana , and most unluckily mr. 
 darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs . they 
 were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had 
 with braid on them , and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears 
 coming . of course mrs. darling brushed him , but he began to talk again 
 about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse . 

 “ george , nana is a treasure . ” 

 “ no doubt , but i have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the 
 children as puppies . ” 

 “ oh no , dear one , i feel sure she knows they have souls . ” 

 “ i wonder , ” mr. darling said thoughtfully , “ i wonder . ” it was an 
 opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy . at first he 
 pooh - poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the 
 shadow . 

 “ it is nobody i know , ” he said , examining it carefully , “ but it does 
 look a scoundrel . ” 

 “ we were still discussing it , you remember , ” says mr. darling , “ when 
 nana came in with michael 's medicine . you will never carry the bottle in 
 your mouth again , nana , and it is all my fault . ” 

 strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather 
 foolishly over the medicine . if he had a weakness , it was for thinking 
 that all his life he had taken medicine boldly , and so now , when michael 
 dodged the spoon in nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , “ be a man , 
 michael . ” 

 “ wo n't ; wo n't ! ” michael cried naughtily . mrs. darling left the room to 
 get a chocolate for him , and mr. darling thought this showed want of 
 firmness . 

 “ mother , do n't pamper him , ” he called after her . “ michael , when i was 
 your age i took medicine without a murmur . i said , ' thank you , kind 
 parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . ' ” 

 he really thought this was true , and wendy , who was now in her 
 night - gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage michael , “ that 
 medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? ” 

 “ ever so much nastier , ” mr. darling said bravely , “ and i would take it 
 now as an example to you , michael , if i had n't lost the bottle . ” 

 he had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the 
 top of the wardrobe and hidden it there . what he did not know was that 
 the faithful liza had found it , and put it back on his wash - stand . 

 “ i know where it is , father , ” wendy cried , always glad to be of service . 
 “ i 'll bring it , ” and she was off before he could stop her . immediately 
 his spirits sank in the strangest way . 

 “ john , ” he said , shuddering , “ it 's most beastly stuff . it 's that nasty , 
 sticky , sweet kind . ” 

 “ it will soon be over , father , ” john said cheerily , and then in rushed 
 wendy with the medicine in a glass . 

 “ i have been as quick as i could , ” she panted . 

 “ you have been wonderfully quick , ” her father retorted , with a 
 vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her . “ michael 
 first , ” he said doggedly . 

 “ father first , ” said michael , who was of a suspicious nature . 

 “ i shall be sick , you know , ” mr. darling said threateningly . 

 “ come on , father , ” said john . 

 “ hold your tongue , john , ” his father rapped out . 

 wendy was quite puzzled . “ i thought you took it quite easily , father . ” 

 “ that is not the point , ” he retorted . “ the point is , that there is 
 more in my glass than in michael 's spoon . ” his proud heart was nearly 
 bursting . “ and it is n't fair : i would say it though it were with my last 
 breath ; it is n't fair . ” 

 “ father , i am waiting , ” said michael coldly . 

 “ it 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am i waiting . ” 

 “ father 's a cowardly custard . ” 

 “ so are you a cowardly custard . ” 

 “ i 'm not frightened . ” 

 “ neither am i frightened . ” 

 “ well , then , take it . ” 

 “ well , then , you take it . ” 

 wendy had a splendid idea . “ why not both take it at the same time ? ” 

 “ certainly , ” said mr. darling . “ are you ready , michael ? ” 

 wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and michael took his medicine , 
 but mr. darling slipped his behind his back . 

 there was a yell of rage from michael , and “ o father ! ” wendy exclaimed . 

 “ what do you mean by ' o father ' ? ” mr. darling demanded . “ stop that row , 
 michael . i meant to take mine , but i -- i missed it . ” 

 it was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if 
 they did not admire him . “ look here , all of you , ” he said entreatingly , 
 as soon as nana had gone into the bathroom . “ i have just thought of a 
 splendid joke . i shall pour my medicine into nana 's bowl , and she will 
 drink it , thinking it is milk ! ” 

 it was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's 
 sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the 
 medicine into nana 's bowl . “ what fun ! ” he said doubtfully , and they did 
 not dare expose him when mrs. darling and nana returned . 

 “ nana , good dog , ” he said , patting her , “ i have put a little milk into 
 your bowl , nana . ” 

 nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it . then 
 she gave mr. darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the 
 great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her 
 kennel . 

 mr. darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give 
 in . in a horrid silence mrs. darling smelt the bowl . “ o george , ” she 
 said , “ it 's your medicine ! ” 

 “ it was only a joke , ” he roared , while she comforted her boys , and wendy 
 hugged nana . “ much good , ” he said bitterly , “ my wearing myself to the 
 bone trying to be funny in this house . ” 

 and still wendy hugged nana . “ that 's right , ” he shouted . “ coddle her ! 
 nobody coddles me . oh dear no ! i am only the breadwinner , why should i 
 be coddled -- why , why , why ! ” 

 “ george , ” mrs. darling entreated him , “ not so loud ; the servants 
 will hear you . ” somehow they had got into the way of calling liza the 
 servants . 

 “ let them ! ” he answered recklessly . “ bring in the whole world . but i 
 refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . ” 

 the children wept , and nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her 
 back . he felt he was a strong man again . “ in vain , in vain , ” he cried ; 
 “ the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up 
 this instant . ” 

 “ george , george , ” mrs. darling whispered , “ remember what i told you 
 about that boy . ” 

 alas , he would not listen . he was determined to show who was master in 
 that house , and when commands would not draw nana from the kennel , he 
 lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged 
 her from the nursery . he was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it . 
 it was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for 
 admiration . when he had tied her up in the back - yard , the wretched 
 father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes . 

 in the meantime mrs. darling had put the children to bed in unwonted 
 silence and lit their night - lights . they could hear nana barking , and 
 john whimpered , “ it is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ” but 
 wendy was wiser . 

 “ that is not nana 's unhappy bark , ” she said , little guessing what was 
 about to happen ; “ that is her bark when she smells danger . ” 

 danger ! 

 “ are you sure , wendy ? ” 

 “ oh , yes . ” 

 mrs. darling quivered and went to the window . it was securely fastened . 
 she looked out , and the night was peppered with stars . they were 
 crowding round the house , as if curious to see what was to take place 
 there , but she did not notice this , nor that one or two of the smaller 
 ones winked at her . yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made 
 her cry , “ oh , how i wish that i was n't going to a party to - night ! ” 

 even michael , already half asleep , knew that she was perturbed , and he 
 asked , “ can anything harm us , mother , after the night - lights are lit ? ” 

 “ nothing , precious , ” she said ; “ they are the eyes a mother leaves behind 
 her to guard her children . ” 

 she went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them , and little 
 michael flung his arms round her . “ mother , ” he cried , “ i 'm glad of you . ” 
  they were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time . 

 no . 27 was only a few yards distant , but there had been a slight fall of 
 snow , and father and mother darling picked their way over it deftly not 
 to soil their shoes . they were already the only persons in the street , 
 and all the stars were watching them . stars are beautiful , but they may 
 not take an active part in anything , they must just look on for ever . it 
 is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no 
 star now knows what it was . so the older ones have become glassy - eyed 
 and seldom speak ( winking is the star language ) , but the little 
 ones still wonder . they are not really friendly to peter , who had a 
 mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out ; 
 but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to - night , and 
 anxious to get the grown - ups out of the way . so as soon as the door 
 of 27 closed on mr. and mrs. darling there was a commotion in the 
 firmament , and the smallest of all the stars in the milky way screamed 
 out : 

 “ now , peter ! ” 




 chapter 3 come away , come away ! 

 for a moment after mr. and mrs. darling left the house the night - lights 
 by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly . they were 
 awfully nice little night - lights , and one can not help wishing that they 
 could have kept awake to see peter ; but wendy 's light blinked and gave 
 such a yawn that the other two yawned also , and before they could close 
 their mouths all the three went out . 

 there was another light in the room now , a thousand times brighter than 
 the night - lights , and in the time we have taken to say this , it had been 
 in all the drawers in the nursery , looking for peter 's shadow , rummaged 
 the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out . it was not really a 
 light ; it made this light by flashing about so quickly , but when it came 
 to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy , no longer than your hand , 
 but still growing . it was a girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned 
 in a skeleton leaf , cut low and square , through which her figure could 
 be seen to the best advantage . she was slightly inclined to embonpoint . 
 [ plump hourglass figure ] 

 a moment after the fairy 's entrance the window was blown open by the 
 breathing of the little stars , and peter dropped in . he had carried 
 tinker bell part of the way , and his hand was still messy with the fairy 
 dust . 

 “ tinker bell , ” he called softly , after making sure that the children 
 were asleep , “ tink , where are you ? ” she was in a jug for the moment , and 
 liking it extremely ; she had never been in a jug before . 

 “ oh , do come out of that jug , and tell me , do you know where they put my 
 shadow ? ” 

 the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him . it is the fairy 
 language . you ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to 
 hear it you would know that you had heard it once before . 

 tink said that the shadow was in the big box . she meant the chest of 
 drawers , and peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to 
 the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd . in a 
 moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he 
 had shut tinker bell up in the drawer . 

 if he thought at all , but i do n't believe he ever thought , it was that 
 he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops 
 of water , and when they did not he was appalled . he tried to stick it 
 on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed . a shudder passed 
 through peter , and he sat on the floor and cried . 

 his sobs woke wendy , and she sat up in bed . she was not alarmed to see 
 a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly 
 interested . 

 “ boy , ” she said courteously , “ why are you crying ? ” 

 peter could be exceeding polite also , having learned the grand manner at 
 fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully . she was much 
 pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed . 

 “ what 's your name ? ” he asked . 

 “ wendy moira angela darling , ” she replied with some satisfaction . “ what 
 is your name ? ” 

 “ peter pan . ” 

 she was already sure that he must be peter , but it did seem a 
 comparatively short name . 

 “ is that all ? ” 

 “ yes , ” he said rather sharply . he felt for the first time that it was a 
 shortish name . 

 “ i 'm so sorry , ” said wendy moira angela . 

 “ it does n't matter , ” peter gulped . 

 she asked where he lived . 

 “ second to the right , ” said peter , “ and then straight on till morning . ” 

 “ what a funny address ! ” 

 peter had a sinking . for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a 
 funny address . 

 “ no , it is n't , ” he said . 

 “ i mean , ” wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , “ is that 
 what they put on the letters ? ” 

 he wished she had not mentioned letters . 

 “ do n't get any letters , ” he said contemptuously . 

 “ but your mother gets letters ? ” 

 “ do n't have a mother , ” he said . not only had he no mother , but he had 
 not the slightest desire to have one . he thought them very over - rated 
 persons . wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a 
 tragedy . 

 “ o peter , no wonder you were crying , ” she said , and got out of bed and 
 ran to him . 

 “ i was n't crying about mothers , ” he said rather indignantly . “ i was 
 crying because i ca n't get my shadow to stick on . besides , i was n't 
 crying . ” 

 “ it has come off ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 then wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was 
 frightfully sorry for peter . “ how awful ! ” she said , but she could not 
 help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with 
 soap . how exactly like a boy ! 

 fortunately she knew at once what to do . “ it must be sewn on , ” she said , 
 just a little patronisingly . 

 “ what 's sewn ? ” he asked . 

 “ you 're dreadfully ignorant . ” 

 “ no , i 'm not . ” 

 but she was exulting in his ignorance . “ i shall sew it on for you , my 
 little man , ” she said , though he was tall as herself , and she got out 
 her housewife [ sewing bag ] , and sewed the shadow on to peter 's foot . 

 “ i daresay it will hurt a little , ” she warned him . 

 “ oh , i sha n't cry , ” said peter , who was already of the opinion that he 
 had never cried in his life . and he clenched his teeth and did not 
 cry , and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little 
 creased . 

 “ perhaps i should have ironed it , ” wendy said thoughtfully , but peter , 
 boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in 
 the wildest glee . alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss 
 to wendy . he thought he had attached the shadow himself . “ how clever i 
 am ! ” he crowed rapturously , “ oh , the cleverness of me ! ” 

 it is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter was 
 one of his most fascinating qualities . to put it with brutal frankness , 
 there never was a cockier boy . 

 but for the moment wendy was shocked . “ you conceit [ braggart ] , ” she 
 exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; “ of course i did nothing ! ” 

 “ you did a little , ” peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . 

 “ a little ! ” she replied with hauteur [ pride ] ; “ if i am no use i can at 
 least withdraw , ” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and 
 covered her face with the blankets . 

 to induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this 
 failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot . 
 “ wendy , ” he said , “ do n't withdraw . i ca n't help crowing , wendy , when 
 i 'm pleased with myself . ” still she would not look up , though she was 
 listening eagerly . “ wendy , ” he continued , in a voice that no woman has 
 ever yet been able to resist , “ wendy , one girl is more use than twenty 
 boys . ” 

 now wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many 
 inches , and she peeped out of the bed - clothes . 

 “ do you really think so , peter ? ” 

 “ yes , i do . ” 

 “ i think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ” she declared , “ and i 'll get up 
 again , ” and she sat with him on the side of the bed . she also said 
 she would give him a kiss if he liked , but peter did not know what she 
 meant , and he held out his hand expectantly . 

 “ surely you know what a kiss is ? ” she asked , aghast . 

 “ i shall know when you give it to me , ” he replied stiffly , and not to 
 hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble . 

 “ now , ” said he , “ shall i give you a kiss ? ” and she replied with a slight 
 primness , “ if you please . ” she made herself rather cheap by inclining 
 her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her 
 hand , so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and 
 said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck . 
 it was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to 
 save her life . 

 when people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to 
 ask each other 's age , and so wendy , who always liked to do the correct 
 thing , asked peter how old he was . it was not really a happy question to 
 ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what 
 you want to be asked is kings of england . 

 “ i do n't know , ” he replied uneasily , “ but i am quite young . ” he really 
 knew nothing about it , he had merely suspicions , but he said at a 
 venture , “ wendy , i ran away the day i was born . ” 

 wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the 
 charming drawing - room manner , by a touch on her night - gown , that he 
 could sit nearer her . 

 “ it was because i heard father and mother , ” he explained in a low 
 voice , “ talking about what i was to be when i became a man . ” he was 
 extraordinarily agitated now . “ i do n't want ever to be a man , ” he said 
 with passion . “ i want always to be a little boy and to have fun . so 
 i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the 
 fairies . ” 

 she gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it 
 was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies . 
 wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as 
 quite delightful . she poured out questions about them , to his surprise , 
 for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , 
 and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [ spanking ] . still , he 
 liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies . 

 “ you see , wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its 
 laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , 
 and that was the beginning of fairies . ” 

 tedious talk this , but being a stay - at - home she liked it . 

 “ and so , ” he went on good - naturedly , “ there ought to be one fairy for 
 every boy and girl . ” 

 “ ought to be ? is n't there ? ” 

 “ no . you see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in 
 fairies , and every time a child says , ' i do n't believe in fairies , ' 
 there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead . ” 

 really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it 
 struck him that tinker bell was keeping very quiet . “ i ca n't think where 
 she has gone to , ” he said , rising , and he called tink by name . wendy 's 
 heart went flutter with a sudden thrill . 

 “ peter , ” she cried , clutching him , “ you do n't mean to tell me that there 
 is a fairy in this room ! ” 

 “ she was here just now , ” he said a little impatiently . “ you do n't hear 
 her , do you ? ” and they both listened . 

 “ the only sound i hear , ” said wendy , “ is like a tinkle of bells . ” 

 “ well , that 's tink , that 's the fairy language . i think i hear her too . ” 

 the sound came from the chest of drawers , and peter made a merry face . 
 no one could ever look quite so merry as peter , and the loveliest of 
 gurgles was his laugh . he had his first laugh still . 

 “ wendy , ” he whispered gleefully , “ i do believe i shut her up in the 
 drawer ! ” 

 he let poor tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery 
 screaming with fury . “ you should n't say such things , ” peter retorted . 
 “ of course i 'm very sorry , but how could i know you were in the drawer ? ” 

 wendy was not listening to him . “ o peter , ” she cried , “ if she would only 
 stand still and let me see her ! ” 

 “ they hardly ever stand still , ” he said , but for one moment wendy saw 
 the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . “ o the lovely ! ” 
  she cried , though tink 's face was still distorted with passion . 

 “ tink , ” said peter amiably , “ this lady says she wishes you were her 
 fairy . ” 

 tinker bell answered insolently . 

 “ what does she say , peter ? ” 

 he had to translate . “ she is not very polite . she says you are a great 
 [ huge ] ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . ” 

 he tried to argue with tink . “ you know you ca n't be my fairy , tink , 
 because i am an gentleman and you are a lady . ” 

 to this tink replied in these words , “ you silly ass , ” and disappeared 
 into the bathroom . “ she is quite a common fairy , ” peter explained 
 apologetically , “ she is called tinker bell because she mends the pots 
 and kettles [ tinker = tin worker ] . ” [ similar to “ cinder ” plus “ elle ” to 
 get cinderella ] 

 they were together in the armchair by this time , and wendy plied him 
 with more questions . 

 “ if you do n't live in kensington gardens now-- ” 

 “ sometimes i do still . ” 

 “ but where do you live mostly now ? ” 

 “ with the lost boys . ” 

 “ who are they ? ” 

 “ they are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the 
 nurse is looking the other way . if they are not claimed in seven 
 days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses . i 'm 
 captain . ” 

 “ what fun it must be ! ” 

 “ yes , ” said cunning peter , “ but we are rather lonely . you see we have no 
 female companionship . ” 

 “ are none of the others girls ? ” 

 “ oh , no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their 
 prams . ” 

 this flattered wendy immensely . “ i think , ” she said , “ it is perfectly 
 lovely the way you talk about girls ; john there just despises us . ” 

 for reply peter rose and kicked john out of bed , blankets and all ; one 
 kick . this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she 
 told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house . however , 
 john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him 
 to remain there . “ and i know you meant to be kind , ” she said , relenting , 
 “ so you may give me a kiss . ” 

 for the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . “ i thought 
 you would want it back , ” he said a little bitterly , and offered to 
 return her the thimble . 

 “ oh dear , ” said the nice wendy , “ i do n't mean a kiss , i mean a thimble . ” 

 “ what 's that ? ” 

 “ it 's like this . ” she kissed him . 

 “ funny ! ” said peter gravely . “ now shall i give you a thimble ? ” 

 “ if you wish to , ” said wendy , keeping her head erect this time . 

 peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched . “ what is it , 
 wendy ? ” 

 “ it was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair . ” 

 “ that must have been tink . i never knew her so naughty before . ” 

 and indeed tink was darting about again , using offensive language . 

 “ she says she will do that to you , wendy , every time i give you a 
 thimble . ” 

 “ but why ? ” 

 “ why , tink ? ” 

 again tink replied , “ you silly ass . ” peter could not understand why , 
 but wendy understood , and she was just slightly disappointed when he 
 admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen 
 to stories . 

 “ you see , i do n't know any stories . none of the lost boys knows any 
 stories . ” 

 “ how perfectly awful , ” wendy said . 

 “ do you know , ” peter asked “ why swallows build in the eaves of houses ? 
 it is to listen to the stories . o wendy , your mother was telling you 
 such a lovely story . ” 

 “ which story was it ? ” 

 “ about the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass 
 slipper . ” 

 “ peter , ” said wendy excitedly , “ that was cinderella , and he found her , 
 and they lived happily ever after . ” 

 peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been 
 sitting , and hurried to the window . 

 “ where are you going ? ” she cried with misgiving . 

 “ to tell the other boys . ” 

 “ do n't go peter , ” she entreated , “ i know such lots of stories . ” 

 those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she 
 who first tempted him . 

 he came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to 
 have alarmed her , but did not . 

 “ oh , the stories i could tell to the boys ! ” she cried , and then peter 
 gripped her and began to draw her toward the window . 

 “ let me go ! ” she ordered him . 

 “ wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . ” 

 of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , “ oh dear , i 
 ca n't . think of mummy ! besides , i ca n't fly . ” 

 “ i 'll teach you . ” 

 “ oh , how lovely to fly . ” 

 “ i 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . ” 

 “ oo ! ” she exclaimed rapturously . 

 “ wendy , wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be 
 flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . ” 

 “ oo ! ” 

 “ and , wendy , there are mermaids . ” 

 “ mermaids ! with tails ? ” 

 “ such long tails . ” 

 “ oh , ” cried wendy , “ to see a mermaid ! ” 

 he had become frightfully cunning . “ wendy , ” he said , “ how we should all 
 respect you . ” 

 she was wriggling her body in distress . it was quite as if she were 
 trying to remain on the nursery floor . 

 but he had no pity for her . 

 “ wendy , ” he said , the sly one , “ you could tuck us in at night . ” 

 “ oo ! ” 

 “ none of us has ever been tucked in at night . ” 

 “ oo , ” and her arms went out to him . 

 “ and you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us . none of us has 
 any pockets . ” 

 how could she resist . “ of course it 's awfully fascinating ! ” she cried . 
 “ peter , would you teach john and michael to fly too ? ” 

 “ if you like , ” he said indifferently , and she ran to john and michael 
 and shook them . “ wake up , ” she cried , “ peter pan has come and he is to 
 teach us to fly . ” 

 john rubbed his eyes . “ then i shall get up , ” he said . of course he was 
 on the floor already . “ hallo , ” he said , “ i am up ! ” 

 michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six 
 blades and a saw , but peter suddenly signed silence . their faces assumed 
 the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown - up 
 world . all was as still as salt . then everything was right . no , stop ! 
 everything was wrong . nana , who had been barking distressfully all the 
 evening , was quiet now . it was her silence they had heard . 

 “ out with the light ! hide ! quick ! ” cried john , taking command for the 
 only time throughout the whole adventure . and thus when liza entered , 
 holding nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark , and 
 you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing 
 angelically as they slept . they were really doing it artfully from 
 behind the window curtains . 

 liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the christmas puddings in 
 the kitchen , and had been drawn from them , with a raisin still on her 
 cheek , by nana 's absurd suspicions . she thought the best way of getting 
 a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment , but in 
 custody of course . 

 “ there , you suspicious brute , ” she said , not sorry that nana was in 
 disgrace . “ they are perfectly safe , are n't they ? every one of the little 
 angels sound asleep in bed . listen to their gentle breathing . ” 

 here michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they 
 were nearly detected . nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to 
 drag herself out of liza 's clutches . 

 but liza was dense . “ no more of it , nana , ” she said sternly , pulling 
 her out of the room . “ i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight 
 for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , 
 wo n't master whip you , just . ” 

 she tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think nana ceased to bark ? 
 bring master and missus home from the party ! why , that was just what she 
 wanted . do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her 
 charges were safe ? unfortunately liza returned to her puddings , and 
 nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at 
 the chain until at last she broke it . in another moment she had burst 
 into the dining - room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most 
 expressive way of making a communication . mr. and mrs. darling knew at 
 once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without 
 a good - bye to their hostess they rushed into the street . 

 but it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing 
 behind the curtains , and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minutes . 

 we now return to the nursery . 

 “ it 's all right , ” john announced , emerging from his hiding - place . “ i 
 say , peter , can you really fly ? ” 

 instead of troubling to answer him peter flew around the room , taking 
 the mantelpiece on the way . 

 “ how topping ! ” said john and michael . 

 “ how sweet ! ” cried wendy . 

 “ yes , i 'm sweet , oh , i am sweet ! ” said peter , forgetting his manners 
 again . 

 it looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and 
 then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . 

 “ i say , how do you do it ? ” asked john , rubbing his knee . he was quite a 
 practical boy . 

 “ you just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ” peter explained , “ and they 
 lift you up in the air . ” 

 he showed them again . 

 “ you 're so nippy at it , ” john said , “ could n't you do it very slowly 
 once ? ” 

 peter did it both slowly and quickly . “ i 've got it now , wendy ! ” cried 
 john , but soon he found he had not . not one of them could fly an inch , 
 though even michael was in words of two syllables , and peter did not 
 know a from z. 

 of course peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless 
 the fairy dust has been blown on him . fortunately , as we have mentioned , 
 one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , 
 with the most superb results . 

 “ now just wiggle your shoulders this way , ” he said , “ and let go . ” 

 they were all on their beds , and gallant michael let go first . he did 
 not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne 
 across the room . 

 “ i flewed ! ” he screamed while still in mid - air . 

 john let go and met wendy near the bathroom . 

 “ oh , lovely ! ” 

 “ oh , ripping ! ” 

 “ look at me ! ” 

 “ look at me ! ” 

 “ look at me ! ” 

 they were not nearly so elegant as peter , they could not help kicking a 
 little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is 
 almost nothing so delicious as that . peter gave wendy a hand at first , 
 but had to desist , tink was so indignant . 

 up and down they went , and round and round . heavenly was wendy 's word . 

 “ i say , ” cried john , “ why should n't we all go out ? ” 

 of course it was to this that peter had been luring them . 

 michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion 
 miles . but wendy hesitated . 

 “ mermaids ! ” said peter again . 

 “ oo ! ” 

 “ and there are pirates . ” 

 “ pirates , ” cried john , seizing his sunday hat , “ let us go at once . ” 

 it was just at this moment that mr. and mrs. darling hurried with nana 
 out of 27 . they ran into the middle of the street to look up at the 
 nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze 
 with light , and most heart - gripping sight of all , they could see in 
 shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling 
 round and round , not on the floor but in the air . 

 not three figures , four ! 

 in a tremble they opened the street door . mr. darling would have rushed 
 upstairs , but mrs. darling signed him to go softly . she even tried to 
 make her heart go softly . 

 will they reach the nursery in time ? if so , how delightful for them , and 
 we shall all breathe a sigh of relief , but there will be no story . on 
 the other hand , if they are not in time , i solemnly promise that it will 
 all come right in the end . 

 they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the 
 little stars were watching them . once again the stars blew the window 
 open , and that smallest star of all called out : 

 “ cave , peter ! ” 

 then peter knew that there was not a moment to lose . “ come , ” he cried 
 imperiously , and soared out at once into the night , followed by john and 
 michael and wendy . 

 mr. and mrs. darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late . the 
 birds were flown . 




 chapter 4 the flight 

 “ second to the right , and straight on till morning . ” 

 that , peter had told wendy , was the way to the neverland ; but even 
 birds , carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners , could not 
 have sighted it with these instructions . peter , you see , just said 
 anything that came into his head . 

 at first his companions trusted him implicitly , and so great were the 
 delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or 
 any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy . 

 john and michael raced , michael getting a start . 

 they recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought 
 themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room . 

 not long ago . but how long ago ? they were flying over the sea before 
 this thought began to disturb wendy seriously . john thought it was their 
 second sea and their third night . 

 sometimes it was dark and sometimes light , and now they were very cold 
 and again too warm . did they really feel hungry at times , or were they 
 merely pretending , because peter had such a jolly new way of feeding 
 them ? his way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable 
 for humans and snatch it from them ; then the birds would follow and 
 snatch it back ; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for 
 miles , parting at last with mutual expressions of good - will . but wendy 
 noticed with gentle concern that peter did not seem to know that this 
 was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter , nor even that 
 there are other ways . 

 certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy , they were sleepy ; and that 
 was a danger , for the moment they popped off , down they fell . the awful 
 thing was that peter thought this funny . 

 “ there he goes again ! ” he would cry gleefully , as michael suddenly 
 dropped like a stone . 

 “ save him , save him ! ” cried wendy , looking with horror at the cruel 
 sea far below . eventually peter would dive through the air , and catch 
 michael just before he could strike the sea , and it was lovely the way 
 he did it ; but he always waited till the last moment , and you felt it 
 was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life . 
 also he was fond of variety , and the sport that engrossed him one moment 
 would suddenly cease to engage him , so there was always the possibility 
 that the next time you fell he would let you go . 

 he could sleep in the air without falling , by merely lying on his back 
 and floating , but this was , partly at least , because he was so light 
 that if you got behind him and blew he went faster . 

 “ do be more polite to him , ” wendy whispered to john , when they were 
 playing “ follow my leader . ” 

 “ then tell him to stop showing off , ” said john . 

 when playing follow my leader , peter would fly close to the water and 
 touch each shark 's tail in passing , just as in the street you may run 
 your finger along an iron railing . they could not follow him in this 
 with much success , so perhaps it was rather like showing off , especially 
 as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed . 

 “ you must be nice to him , ” wendy impressed on her brothers . “ what could 
 we do if he were to leave us ! ” 

 “ we could go back , ” michael said . 

 “ how could we ever find our way back without him ? ” 

 “ well , then , we could go on , ” said john . 

 “ that is the awful thing , john . we should have to go on , for we do n't 
 know how to stop . ” 

 this was true , peter had forgotten to show them how to stop . 

 john said that if the worst came to the worst , all they had to do was to 
 go straight on , for the world was round , and so in time they must come 
 back to their own window . 

 “ and who is to get food for us , john ? ” 

 “ i nipped a bit out of that eagle 's mouth pretty neatly , wendy . ” 

 “ after the twentieth try , ” wendy reminded him . “ and even though we 
 became good at picking up food , see how we bump against clouds and things 
 if he is not near to give us a hand . ” 

 indeed they were constantly bumping . they could now fly strongly , though 
 they still kicked far too much ; but if they saw a cloud in front of 
 them , the more they tried to avoid it , the more certainly did they bump 
 into it . if nana had been with them , she would have had a bandage round 
 michael 's forehead by this time . 

 peter was not with them for the moment , and they felt rather lonely up 
 there by themselves . he could go so much faster than they that he would 
 suddenly shoot out of sight , to have some adventure in which they had no 
 share . he would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had 
 been saying to a star , but he had already forgotten what it was , or he 
 would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him , and yet not be 
 able to say for certain what had been happening . it was really rather 
 irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid . 

 “ and if he forgets them so quickly , ” wendy argued , “ how can we expect 
 that he will go on remembering us ? ” 

 indeed , sometimes when he returned he did not remember them , at least 
 not well . wendy was sure of it . she saw recognition come into his eyes 
 as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on ; once even she 
 had to call him by name . 

 “ i 'm wendy , ” she said agitatedly . 

 he was very sorry . “ i say , wendy , ” he whispered to her , “ always if you 
 see me forgetting you , just keep on saying ' i 'm wendy , ' and then i 'll 
 remember . ” 

 of course this was rather unsatisfactory . however , to make amends he 
 showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their 
 way , and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several 
 times and found that they could sleep thus with security . indeed they 
 would have slept longer , but peter tired quickly of sleeping , and soon 
 he would cry in his captain voice , “ we get off here . ” so with occasional 
 tiffs , but on the whole rollicking , they drew near the neverland ; for 
 after many moons they did reach it , and , what is more , they had been 
 going pretty straight all the time , not perhaps so much owing to the 
 guidance of peter or tink as because the island was looking for them . it 
 is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores . 

 “ there it is , ” said peter calmly . 

 “ where , where ? ” 

 “ where all the arrows are pointing . ” 

 indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children , all 
 directed by their friend the sun , who wanted them to be sure of their 
 way before leaving them for the night . 

 wendy and john and michael stood on tip - toe in the air to get their 
 first sight of the island . strange to say , they all recognized it at 
 once , and until fear fell upon them they hailed it , not as something 
 long dreamt of and seen at last , but as a familiar friend to whom they 
 were returning home for the holidays . 

 “ john , there 's the lagoon . ” 

 “ wendy , look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand . ” 

 “ i say , john , i see your flamingo with the broken leg ! ” 

 “ look , michael , there 's your cave ! ” 

 “ john , what 's that in the brushwood ? ” 

 “ it 's a wolf with her whelps . wendy , i do believe that 's your little 
 whelp ! ” 

 “ there 's my boat , john , with her sides stove in ! ” 

 “ no , it is n't . why , we burned your boat . ” 

 “ that 's her , at any rate . i say , john , i see the smoke of the redskin 
 camp ! ” 

 “ where ? show me , and i 'll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they 
 are on the war - path . ” 

 “ there , just across the mysterious river . ” 

 “ i see now . yes , they are on the war - path right enough . ” 

 peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much , but if he 
 wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand , for have i not told 
 you that anon fear fell upon them ? 

 it came as the arrows went , leaving the island in gloom . 

 in the old days at home the neverland had always begun to look a little 
 dark and threatening by bedtime . then unexplored patches arose in it 
 and spread , black shadows moved about in them , the roar of the beasts of 
 prey was quite different now , and above all , you lost the certainty that 
 you would win . you were quite glad that the night - lights were on . you 
 even liked nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and 
 that the neverland was all make - believe . 

 of course the neverland had been make - believe in those days , but it 
 was real now , and there were no night - lights , and it was getting darker 
 every moment , and where was nana ? 

 they had been flying apart , but they huddled close to peter now . his 
 careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle 
 went through them every time they touched his body . they were now over 
 the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their 
 feet . nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had 
 become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way 
 through hostile forces . sometimes they hung in the air until peter had 
 beaten on it with his fists . 

 “ they do n't want us to land , ” he explained . 

 “ who are they ? ” wendy whispered , shuddering . 

 but he could not or would not say . tinker bell had been asleep on his 
 shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front . 

 sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently , with his 
 hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that 
 they seemed to bore two holes to earth . having done these things , he 
 went on again . 

 his courage was almost appalling . “ would you like an adventure now , ” he 
 said casually to john , “ or would you like to have your tea first ? ” 

 wendy said “ tea first ” quickly , and michael pressed her hand in 
 gratitude , but the braver john hesitated . 

 “ what kind of adventure ? ” he asked cautiously . 

 “ there 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ” peter told him . 
 “ if you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ” 

 “ i do n't see him , ” john said after a long pause . 

 “ i do . ” 

 “ suppose , ” john said , a little huskily , “ he were to wake up . ” 

 peter spoke indignantly . “ you do n't think i would kill him while he was 
 sleeping ! i would wake him first , and then kill him . that 's the way i 
 always do . ” 

 “ i say ! do you kill many ? ” 

 “ tons . ” 

 john said “ how ripping , ” but decided to have tea first . he asked if 
 there were many pirates on the island just now , and peter said he had 
 never known so many . 

 “ who is captain now ? ” 

 “ hook , ” answered peter , and his face became very stern as he said that 
 hated word . 

 “ jas . hook ? ” 

 “ ay . ” 

 then indeed michael began to cry , and even john could speak in gulps 
 only , for they knew hook 's reputation . 

 “ he was blackbeard 's bo'sun , ” john whispered huskily . “ he is the worst 
 of them all . he is the only man of whom barbecue was afraid . ” 

 “ that 's him , ” said peter . 

 “ what is he like ? is he big ? ” 

 “ he is not so big as he was . ” 

 “ how do you mean ? ” 

 “ i cut off a bit of him . ” 

 “ you ! ” 

 “ yes , me , ” said peter sharply . 

 “ i was n't meaning to be disrespectful . ” 

 “ oh , all right . ” 

 “ but , i say , what bit ? ” 

 “ his right hand . ” 

 “ then he ca n't fight now ? ” 

 “ oh , ca n't he just ! ” 

 “ left - hander ? ” 

 “ he has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . ” 

 “ claws ! ” 

 “ i say , john , ” said peter . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ say , ' ay , ay , sir . ' ” 

 “ ay , ay , sir . ” 

 “ there is one thing , ” peter continued , “ that every boy who serves under 
 me has to promise , and so must you . ” 

 john paled . 

 “ it is this , if we meet hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ” 

 “ i promise , ” john said loyally . 

 for the moment they were feeling less eerie , because tink was flying 
 with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other . 
 unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go 
 round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo . wendy 
 quite liked it , until peter pointed out the drawbacks . 

 “ she tells me , ” he said , “ that the pirates sighted us before the 
 darkness came , and got long tom out . ” 

 “ the big gun ? ” 

 “ yes . and of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are 
 near it they are sure to let fly . ” 

 “ wendy ! ” 

 “ john ! ” 

 “ michael ! ” 

 “ tell her to go away at once , peter , ” the three cried simultaneously , 
 but he refused . 

 “ she thinks we have lost the way , ” he replied stiffly , “ and she is 
 rather frightened . you do n't think i would send her away all by herself 
 when she is frightened ! ” 

 for a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave peter a 
 loving little pinch . 

 “ then tell her , ” wendy begged , “ to put out her light . ” 

 “ she ca n't put it out . that is about the only thing fairies ca n't do . it 
 just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . ” 

 “ then tell her to sleep at once , ” john almost ordered . 

 “ she ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy . it is the only other thing 
 fairies ca n't do . ” 

 “ seems to me , ” growled john , “ these are the only two things worth 
 doing . ” 

 here he got a pinch , but not a loving one . 

 “ if only one of us had a pocket , ” peter said , “ we could carry her in 
 it . ” however , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a 
 pocket between the four of them . 

 he had a happy idea . john 's hat ! 

 tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand . john carried 
 it , though she had hoped to be carried by peter . presently wendy took 
 the hat , because john said it struck against his knee as he flew ; and 
 this , as we shall see , led to mischief , for tinker bell hated to be 
 under an obligation to wendy . 

 in the black topper the light was completely hidden , and they flew on in 
 silence . it was the stillest silence they had ever known , broken once by 
 a distant lapping , which peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at 
 the ford , and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches 
 of trees rubbing together , but he said it was the redskins sharpening 
 their knives . 

 even these noises ceased . to michael the loneliness was dreadful . “ if 
 only something would make a sound ! ” he cried . 

 as if in answer to his request , the air was rent by the most tremendous 
 crash he had ever heard . the pirates had fired long tom at them . 

 the roar of it echoed through the mountains , and the echoes seemed to 
 cry savagely , “ where are they , where are they , where are they ? ” 

 thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an 
 island of make - believe and the same island come true . 

 when at last the heavens were steady again , john and michael 
 found themselves alone in the darkness . john was treading the air 
 mechanically , and michael without knowing how to float was floating . 

 “ are you shot ? ” john whispered tremulously . 

 “ i have n't tried [ myself out ] yet , ” michael whispered back . 

 we know now that no one had been hit . peter , however , had been carried 
 by the wind of the shot far out to sea , while wendy was blown upwards 
 with no companion but tinker bell . 

 it would have been well for wendy if at that moment she had dropped the 
 hat . 

 i do n't know whether the idea came suddenly to tink , or whether she had 
 planned it on the way , but she at once popped out of the hat and began 
 to lure wendy to her destruction . 

 tink was not all bad ; or , rather , she was all bad just now , but , on the 
 other hand , sometimes she was all good . fairies have to be one thing or 
 the other , because being so small they unfortunately have room for one 
 feeling only at a time . they are , however , allowed to change , only it 
 must be a complete change . at present she was full of jealousy of wendy . 
 what she said in her lovely tinkle wendy could not of course understand , 
 and i believe some of it was bad words , but it sounded kind , and she 
 flew back and forward , plainly meaning “ follow me , and all will be 
 well . ” 

 what else could poor wendy do ? she called to peter and john and michael , 
 and got only mocking echoes in reply . she did not yet know that tink 
 hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman . and so , bewildered , 
 and now staggering in her flight , she followed tink to her doom . 




 chapter 5 the island come true 

 feeling that peter was on his way back , the neverland had again woke 
 into life . we ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened , but woke is 
 better and was always used by peter . 

 in his absence things are usually quiet on the island . the fairies take 
 an hour longer in the morning , the beasts attend to their young , the 
 redskins feed heavily for six days and nights , and when pirates and 
 lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other . but with the 
 coming of peter , who hates lethargy , they are under way again : if you 
 put your ear to the ground now , you would hear the whole island seething 
 with life . 

 on this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows . 
 the lost boys were out looking for peter , the pirates were out looking 
 for the lost boys , the redskins were out looking for the pirates , and 
 the beasts were out looking for the redskins . they were going round and 
 round the island , but they did not meet because all were going at the 
 same rate . 

 all wanted blood except the boys , who liked it as a rule , but to - night 
 were out to greet their captain . the boys on the island vary , of course , 
 in numbers , according as they get killed and so on ; and when they seem 
 to be growing up , which is against the rules , peter thins them out ; but 
 at this time there were six of them , counting the twins as two . let us 
 pretend to lie here among the sugar - cane and watch them as they steal by 
 in single file , each with his hand on his dagger . 

 they are forbidden by peter to look in the least like him , and they wear 
 the skins of the bears slain by themselves , in which they are so round 
 and furry that when they fall they roll . they have therefore become very 
 sure - footed . 

 the first to pass is tootles , not the least brave but the most 
 unfortunate of all that gallant band . he had been in fewer adventures 
 than any of them , because the big things constantly happened just when 
 he had stepped round the corner ; all would be quiet , he would take the 
 opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood , and 
 then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood . this 
 ill - luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance , but instead 
 of souring his nature had sweetened it , so that he was quite the 
 humblest of the boys . poor kind tootles , there is danger in the air for 
 you to - night . take care lest an adventure is now offered you , which , if 
 accepted , will plunge you in deepest woe . tootles , the fairy tink , who 
 is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [ for doing her 
 mischief ] , and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys . 
 ' ware tinker bell . 

 would that he could hear us , but we are not really on the island , and he 
 passes by , biting his knuckles . 

 next comes nibs , the gay and debonair , followed by slightly , who cuts 
 whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes . 
 slightly is the most conceited of the boys . he thinks he remembers the 
 days before he was lost , with their manners and customs , and this has 
 given his nose an offensive tilt . curly is fourth ; he is a pickle , [ a 
 person who gets in pickles - predicaments ] and so often has he had to 
 deliver up his person when peter said sternly , “ stand forth the one who 
 did this thing , ” that now at the command he stands forth automatically 
 whether he has done it or not . last come the twins , who can not be 
 described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one . 
 peter never quite knew what twins were , and his band were not allowed 
 to know anything he did not know , so these two were always vague about 
 themselves , and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close 
 together in an apologetic sort of way . 

 the boys vanish in the gloom , and after a pause , but not a long pause , 
 for things go briskly on the island , come the pirates on their track . we 
 hear them before they are seen , and it is always the same dreadful song : 

      “ avast belay , yo ho , heave to , 
      a - pirating we go , 
      and if we 're parted by a shot 
      we 're sure to meet below ! ” 

 a more villainous - looking lot never hung in a row on execution dock . 
 here , a little in advance , ever and again with his head to the 
 ground listening , his great arms bare , pieces of eight in his ears as 
 ornaments , is the handsome italian cecco , who cut his name in letters 
 of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at gao . that gigantic 
 black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with 
 which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the 
 guadjo - mo . here is bill jukes , every inch of him tattooed , the same bill 
 jukes who got six dozen on the walrus from flint before he would drop 
 the bag of moidores [ portuguese gold pieces ] ; and cookson , said to 
 be black murphy 's brother ( but this was never proved ) , and gentleman 
 starkey , once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways 
 of killing ; and skylights ( morgan 's skylights ) ; and the irish bo'sun 
 smee , an oddly genial man who stabbed , so to speak , without offence , 
 and was the only non - conformist in hook 's crew ; and noodler , whose 
 hands were fixed on backwards ; and robt . mullins and alf mason and many 
 another ruffian long known and feared on the spanish main . 

 in the midst of them , the blackest and largest in that dark setting , 
 reclined james hook , or as he wrote himself , jas . hook , of whom it is 
 said he was the only man that the sea - cook feared . he lay at his ease in 
 a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men , and instead of a right 
 hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them 
 to increase their pace . as dogs this terrible man treated and addressed 
 them , and as dogs they obeyed him . in person he was cadaverous [ dead 
 looking ] and blackavized [ dark faced ] , and his hair was dressed in long 
 curls , which at a little distance looked like black candles , and gave a 
 singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance . his eyes 
 were of the blue of the forget - me - not , and of a profound melancholy , 
 save when he was plunging his hook into you , at which time two red spots 
 appeared in them and lit them up horribly . in manner , something of the 
 grand seigneur still clung to him , so that he even ripped you up with 
 an air , and i have been told that he was a raconteur [ storyteller ] of 
 repute . he was never more sinister than when he was most polite , 
 which is probably the truest test of breeding ; and the elegance of his 
 diction , even when he was swearing , no less than the distinction of his 
 demeanour , showed him one of a different cast from his crew . a man of 
 indomitable courage , it was said that the only thing he shied at was 
 the sight of his own blood , which was thick and of an unusual colour . 
 in dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of charles 
 ii , having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he 
 bore a strange resemblance to the ill - fated stuarts ; and in his mouth 
 he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two 
 cigars at once . but undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron 
 claw . 

 let us now kill a pirate , to show hook 's method . skylights will do . as 
 they pass , skylights lurches clumsily against him , ruffling his lace 
 collar ; the hook shoots forth , there is a tearing sound and one screech , 
 then the body is kicked aside , and the pirates pass on . he has not even 
 taken the cigars from his mouth . 

 such is the terrible man against whom peter pan is pitted . which will 
 win ? 

 on the trail of the pirates , stealing noiselessly down the war - path , 
 which is not visible to inexperienced eyes , come the redskins , every one 
 of them with his eyes peeled . they carry tomahawks and knives , and their 
 naked bodies gleam with paint and oil . strung around them are scalps , of 
 boys as well as of pirates , for these are the piccaninny tribe , and not 
 to be confused with the softer - hearted delawares or the hurons . in 
 the van , on all fours , is great big little panther , a brave of so many 
 scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress . 
 bringing up the rear , the place of greatest danger , comes tiger lily , 
 proudly erect , a princess in her own right . she is the most beautiful 
 of dusky dianas [ diana = goddess of the woods ] and the belle of the 
 piccaninnies , coquettish [ flirting ] , cold and amorous [ loving ] by turns ; 
 there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife , but 
 she staves off the altar with a hatchet . observe how they pass over 
 fallen twigs without making the slightest noise . the only sound to be 
 heard is their somewhat heavy breathing . the fact is that they are all a 
 little fat just now after the heavy gorging , but in time they will work 
 this off . for the moment , however , it constitutes their chief danger . 

 the redskins disappear as they have come like shadows , and soon their 
 place is taken by the beasts , a great and motley procession : lions , 
 tigers , bears , and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee 
 from them , for every kind of beast , and , more particularly , all the 
 man - eaters , live cheek by jowl on the favoured island . their tongues are 
 hanging out , they are hungry to - night . 

 when they have passed , comes the last figure of all , a gigantic 
 crocodile . we shall see for whom she is looking presently . 

 the crocodile passes , but soon the boys appear again , for the procession 
 must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its 
 pace . then quickly they will be on top of each other . 

 all are keeping a sharp look - out in front , but none suspects that the 
 danger may be creeping up from behind . this shows how real the island 
 was . 

 the first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys . they flung 
 themselves down on the sward [ turf ] , close to their underground home . 

 “ i do wish peter would come back , ” every one of them said nervously , 
 though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than 
 their captain . 

 “ i am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates , ” slightly said , in 
 the tone that prevented his being a general favourite ; but perhaps some 
 distant sound disturbed him , for he added hastily , “ but i wish he 
 would come back , and tell us whether he has heard anything more about 
 cinderella . ” 

 they talked of cinderella , and tootles was confident that his mother 
 must have been very like her . 

 it was only in peter 's absence that they could speak of mothers , the 
 subject being forbidden by him as silly . 

 “ all i remember about my mother , ” nibs told them , “ is that she often 
 said to my father , ' oh , how i wish i had a cheque - book of my own ! ' i 
 do n't know what a cheque - book is , but i should just love to give my 
 mother one . ” 

 while they talked they heard a distant sound . you or i , not being wild 
 things of the woods , would have heard nothing , but they heard it , and it 
 was the grim song : 

      “ yo ho , yo ho , the pirate life , 
      the flag o ' skull and bones , 
      a merry hour , a hempen rope , 
      and hey for davy jones . ” 

 at once the lost boys -- but where are they ? they are no longer there . 
 rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly . 

 i will tell you where they are . with the exception of nibs , who has 
 darted away to reconnoitre [ look around ] , they are already in their home 
 under the ground , a very delightful residence of which we shall see 
 a good deal presently . but how have they reached it ? for there is no 
 entrance to be seen , not so much as a large stone , which if rolled away , 
 would disclose the mouth of a cave . look closely , however , and you may 
 note that there are here seven large trees , each with a hole in its 
 hollow trunk as large as a boy . these are the seven entrances to the 
 home under the ground , for which hook has been searching in vain these 
 many moons . will he find it tonight ? 

 as the pirates advanced , the quick eye of starkey sighted nibs 
 disappearing through the wood , and at once his pistol flashed out . but 
 an iron claw gripped his shoulder . 

 “ captain , let go ! ” he cried , writhing . 

 now for the first time we hear the voice of hook . it was a black voice . 
 “ put back that pistol first , ” it said threateningly . 

 “ it was one of those boys you hate . i could have shot him dead . ” 

 “ ay , and the sound would have brought tiger lily 's redskins upon us . do 
 you want to lose your scalp ? ” 

 “ shall i after him , captain , ” asked pathetic smee , “ and tickle him 
 with johnny corkscrew ? ” smee had pleasant names for everything , and his 
 cutlass was johnny corkscrew , because he wiggled it in the wound . one 
 could mention many lovable traits in smee . for instance , after killing , 
 it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon . 

 “ johnny 's a silent fellow , ” he reminded hook . 

 “ not now , smee , ” hook said darkly . “ he is only one , and i want to 
 mischief all the seven . scatter and look for them . ” 

 the pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain 
 and smee were alone . hook heaved a heavy sigh , and i know not why it 
 was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there 
 came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo'sun the story of 
 his life . he spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about smee , 
 who was rather stupid , did not know in the least . 

 anon [ later ] he caught the word peter . 

 “ most of all , ” hook was saying passionately , “ i want their captain , 
 peter pan . ' twas he cut off my arm . ” he brandished the hook 
 threateningly . “ i 've waited long to shake his hand with this . oh , i 'll 
 tear him ! ” 

 “ and yet , ” said smee , “ i have often heard you say that hook was worth a 
 score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . ” 

 “ ay , ” the captain answered , “ if i was a mother i would pray to have my 
 children born with this instead of that , ” and he cast a look of pride 
 upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other . then again he 
 frowned . 

 “ peter flung my arm , ” he said , wincing , “ to a crocodile that happened to 
 be passing by . ” 

 “ i have often , ” said smee , “ noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . ” 

 “ not of crocodiles , ” hook corrected him , “ but of that one crocodile . ” he 
 lowered his voice . “ it liked my arm so much , smee , that it has followed 
 me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips 
 for the rest of me . ” 

 “ in a way , ” said smee , “ it 's sort of a compliment . ” 

 “ i want no such compliments , ” hook barked petulantly . “ i want peter pan , 
 who first gave the brute its taste for me . ” 

 he sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his 
 voice . “ smee , ” he said huskily , “ that crocodile would have had me before 
 this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick 
 inside it , and so before it can reach me i hear the tick and bolt . ” he 
 laughed , but in a hollow way . 

 “ some day , ” said smee , “ the clock will run down , and then he 'll get 
 you . ” 

 hook wetted his dry lips . “ ay , ” he said , “ that 's the fear that haunts 
 me . ” 

 since sitting down he had felt curiously warm . “ smee , ” he said , “ this 
 seat is hot . ” he jumped up . “ odds bobs , hammer and tongs i 'm burning . ” 

 they examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown 
 on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in 
 their hands , for it had no root . stranger still , smoke began at once 
 to ascend . the pirates looked at each other . “ a chimney ! ” they both 
 exclaimed . 

 they had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground . it 
 was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were 
 in the neighbourhood . 

 not only smoke came out of it . there came also children 's voices , for 
 so safe did the boys feel in their hiding - place that they were gaily 
 chattering . the pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom . 
 they looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees . 

 “ did you hear them say peter pan 's from home ? ” smee whispered , fidgeting 
 with johnny corkscrew . 

 hook nodded . he stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a 
 curdling smile lit up his swarthy face . smee had been waiting for it . 
 “ unrip your plan , captain , ” he cried eagerly . 

 “ to return to the ship , ” hook replied slowly through his teeth , “ and 
 cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it . 
 there can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney . the silly 
 moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece . 
 that shows they have no mother . we will leave the cake on the shore 
 of the mermaids ' lagoon . these boys are always swimming about there , 
 playing with the mermaids . they will find the cake and they will gobble 
 it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous ' tis to 
 eat rich damp cake . ” he burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , 
 but honest laughter . “ aha , they will die . ” 

 smee had listened with growing admiration . 

 “ it 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever i heard of ! ” he cried , and in 
 their exultation they danced and sang : 

      “ avast , belay , when i appear , 
      by fear they 're overtook ; 
      nought 's left upon your bones when you 
      have shaken claws with hook . ” 

 they began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound 
 broke in and stilled them . there was at first such a tiny sound that a 
 leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it 
 was more distinct . 

 tick tick tick tick ! 

 hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air . 

 “ the crocodile ! ” he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo'sun . 

 it was indeed the crocodile . it had passed the redskins , who were now on 
 the trail of the other pirates . it oozed on after hook . 

 once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night 
 were not yet over , for presently nibs rushed breathless into their 
 midst , pursued by a pack of wolves . the tongues of the pursuers were 
 hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible . 

 “ save me , save me ! ” cried nibs , falling on the ground . 

 “ but what can we do , what can we do ? ” 

 it was a high compliment to peter that at that dire moment their 
 thoughts turned to him . 

 “ what would peter do ? ” they cried simultaneously . 

 almost in the same breath they cried , “ peter would look at them through 
 his legs . ” 

 and then , “ let us do what peter would do . ” 

 it is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy 
 they bent and looked through their legs . the next moment is the long 
 one , but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in the 
 terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled . 

 now nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring 
 eyes still saw the wolves . but it was not wolves he saw . 

 “ i have seen a wonderfuller thing , ” he cried , as they gathered round him 
 eagerly . “ a great white bird . it is flying this way . ” 

 “ what kind of a bird , do you think ? ” 

 “ i do n't know , ” nibs said , awestruck , “ but it looks so weary , and as it 
 flies it moans , ' poor wendy . ' ” 

 “ poor wendy ? ” 

 “ i remember , ” said slightly instantly , “ there are birds called wendies . ” 

 “ see , it comes ! ” cried curly , pointing to wendy in the heavens . 

 wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry . 
 but more distinct came the shrill voice of tinker bell . the jealous 
 fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting 
 at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she 
 touched . 

 “ hullo , tink , ” cried the wondering boys . 

 tink 's reply rang out : “ peter wants you to shoot the wendy . ” 

 it was not in their nature to question when peter ordered . “ let us do 
 what peter wishes ! ” cried the simple boys . “ quick , bows and arrows ! ” 

 all but tootles popped down their trees . he had a bow and arrow with 
 him , and tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands . 

 “ quick , tootles , quick , ” she screamed . “ peter will be so pleased . ” 

 tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow . “ out of the way , tink , ” 
  he shouted , and then he fired , and wendy fluttered to the ground with an 
 arrow in her breast . 




 chapter 6 the little house 

 foolish tootles was standing like a conqueror over wendy 's body when the 
 other boys sprang , armed , from their trees . 

 “ you are too late , ” he cried proudly , “ i have shot the wendy . peter will 
 be so pleased with me . ” 

 overhead tinker bell shouted “ silly ass ! ” and darted into hiding . the 
 others did not hear her . they had crowded round wendy , and as they 
 looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood . if wendy 's heart had been 
 beating they would all have heard it . 

 slightly was the first to speak . “ this is no bird , ” he said in a scared 
 voice . “ i think this must be a lady . ” 

 “ a lady ? ” said tootles , and fell a - trembling . 

 “ and we have killed her , ” nibs said hoarsely . 

 they all whipped off their caps . 

 “ now i see , ” curly said : “ peter was bringing her to us . ” he threw 
 himself sorrowfully on the ground . 

 “ a lady to take care of us at last , ” said one of the twins , “ and you 
 have killed her ! ” 

 they were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a 
 step nearer them they turned from him . 

 tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that 
 had never been there before . 

 “ i did it , ” he said , reflecting . “ when ladies used to come to me in 
 dreams , i said , ' pretty mother , pretty mother . ' but when at last she 
 really came , i shot her . ” 

 he moved slowly away . 

 “ do n't go , ” they called in pity . 

 “ i must , ” he answered , shaking ; “ i am so afraid of peter . ” 

 it was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the 
 heart of every one of them rise to his mouth . they heard peter crow . 

 “ peter ! ” they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his 
 return . 

 “ hide her , ” they whispered , and gathered hastily around wendy . but 
 tootles stood aloof . 

 again came that ringing crow , and peter dropped in front of them . 
 “ greetings , boys , ” he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then 
 again was silence . 

 he frowned . 

 “ i am back , ” he said hotly , “ why do you not cheer ? ” 

 they opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come . he overlooked 
 it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings . 

 “ great news , boys , ” he cried , “ i have brought at last a mother for you 
 all . ” 

 still no sound , except a little thud from tootles as he dropped on his 
 knees . 

 “ have you not seen her ? ” asked peter , becoming troubled . “ she flew this 
 way . ” 

 “ ah me ! ” one voice said , and another said , “ oh , mournful day . ” 

 tootles rose . “ peter , ” he said quietly , “ i will show her to you , ” and 
 when the others would still have hidden her he said , “ back , twins , let 
 peter see . ” 

 so they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a 
 little time he did not know what to do next . 

 “ she is dead , ” he said uncomfortably . “ perhaps she is frightened at 
 being dead . ” 

 he thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of 
 sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more . they would 
 all have been glad to follow if he had done this . 

 but there was the arrow . he took it from her heart and faced his band . 

 “ whose arrow ? ” he demanded sternly . 

 “ mine , peter , ” said tootles on his knees . 

 “ oh , dastard hand , ” peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a 
 dagger . 

 tootles did not flinch . he bared his breast . “ strike , peter , ” he said 
 firmly , “ strike true . ” 

 twice did peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . “ i can not 
 strike , ” he said with awe , “ there is something stays my hand . ” 

 all looked at him in wonder , save nibs , who fortunately looked at wendy . 

 “ it is she , ” he cried , “ the wendy lady , see , her arm ! ” 

 wonderful to relate [ tell ] , wendy had raised her arm . nibs bent over 
 her and listened reverently . “ i think she said , ' poor tootles , ' ” he 
 whispered . 

 “ she lives , ” peter said briefly . 

 slightly cried instantly , “ the wendy lady lives . ” 

 then peter knelt beside her and found his button . you remember she had 
 put it on a chain that she wore round her neck . 

 “ see , ” he said , “ the arrow struck against this . it is the kiss i gave 
 her . it has saved her life . ” 

 “ i remember kisses , ” slightly interposed quickly , “ let me see it . ay , 
 that 's a kiss . ” 

 peter did not hear him . he was begging wendy to get better quickly , so 
 that he could show her the mermaids . of course she could not answer yet , 
 being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note . 

 “ listen to tink , ” said curly , “ she is crying because the wendy lives . ” 

 then they had to tell peter of tink 's crime , and almost never had they 
 seen him look so stern . 

 “ listen , tinker bell , ” he cried , “ i am your friend no more . begone from 
 me for ever . ” 

 she flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off . not 
 until wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , 
 “ well , not for ever , but for a whole week . ” 

 do you think tinker bell was grateful to wendy for raising her arm ? oh 
 dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much . fairies indeed are strange , 
 and peter , who understood them best , often cuffed [ slapped ] them . 

 but what to do with wendy in her present delicate state of health ? 

 “ let us carry her down into the house , ” curly suggested . 

 “ ay , ” said slightly , “ that is what one does with ladies . ” 

 “ no , no , ” peter said , “ you must not touch her . it would not be 
 sufficiently respectful . ” 

 “ that , ” said slightly , “ is what i was thinking . ” 

 “ but if she lies there , ” tootles said , “ she will die . ” 

 “ ay , she will die , ” slightly admitted , “ but there is no way out . ” 

 “ yes , there is , ” cried peter . “ let us build a little house round her . ” 

 they were all delighted . “ quick , ” he ordered them , “ bring me each of you 
 the best of what we have . gut our house . be sharp . ” 

 in a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding . 
 they skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and 
 while they were at it , who should appear but john and michael . as they 
 dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , 
 moved another step and slept again . 

 “ john , john , ” michael would cry , “ wake up ! where is nana , john , and 
 mother ? ” 

 and then john would rub his eyes and mutter , “ it is true , we did fly . ” 

 you may be sure they were very relieved to find peter . 

 “ hullo , peter , ” they said . 

 “ hullo , ” replied peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them . 
 he was very busy at the moment measuring wendy with his feet to see 
 how large a house she would need . of course he meant to leave room for 
 chairs and a table . john and michael watched him . 

 “ is wendy asleep ? ” they asked . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ john , ” michael proposed , “ let us wake her and get her to make supper 
 for us , ” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying 
 branches for the building of the house . “ look at them ! ” he cried . 

 “ curly , ” said peter in his most captainy voice , “ see that these boys 
 help in the building of the house . ” 

 “ ay , ay , sir . ” 

 “ build a house ? ” exclaimed john . 

 “ for the wendy , ” said curly . 

 “ for wendy ? ” john said , aghast . “ why , she is only a girl ! ” 

 “ that , ” explained curly , “ is why we are her servants . ” 

 “ you ? wendy 's servants ! ” 

 “ yes , ” said peter , “ and you also . away with them . ” 

 the astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry . 
 “ chairs and a fender [ fireplace ] first , ” peter ordered . “ then we shall 
 build a house round them . ” 

 “ ay , ” said slightly , “ that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to 
 me . ” 

 peter thought of everything . “ slightly , ” he cried , “ fetch a doctor . ” 

 “ ay , ay , ” said slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head . 
 but he knew peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing 
 john 's hat and looking solemn . 

 “ please , sir , ” said peter , going to him , “ are you a doctor ? ” 

 the difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that 
 they knew it was make - believe , while to him make - believe and true were 
 exactly the same thing . this sometimes troubled them , as when they had 
 to make - believe that they had had their dinners . 

 if they broke down in their make - believe he rapped them on the knuckles . 

 “ yes , my little man , ” slightly anxiously replied , who had chapped 
 knuckles . 

 “ please , sir , ” peter explained , “ a lady lies very ill . ” 

 she was lying at their feet , but slightly had the sense not to see her . 

 “ tut , tut , tut , ” he said , “ where does she lie ? ” 

 “ in yonder glade . ” 

 “ i will put a glass thing in her mouth , ” said slightly , and he 
 made - believe to do it , while peter waited . it was an anxious moment when 
 the glass thing was withdrawn . 

 “ how is she ? ” inquired peter . 

 “ tut , tut , tut , ” said slightly , “ this has cured her . ” 

 “ i am glad ! ” peter cried . 

 “ i will call again in the evening , ” slightly said ; “ give her beef tea 
 out of a cup with a spout to it ; ” but after he had returned the hat 
 to john he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a 
 difficulty . 

 in the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost 
 everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at wendy 's feet . 

 “ if only we knew , ” said one , “ the kind of house she likes best . ” 

 “ peter , ” shouted another , “ she is moving in her sleep . ” 

 “ her mouth opens , ” cried a third , looking respectfully into it . “ oh , 
 lovely ! ” 

 “ perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ” said peter . “ wendy , sing 
 the kind of house you would like to have . ” 

 immediately , without opening her eyes , wendy began to sing : 

      “ i wish i had a pretty house , 
      the littlest ever seen , 
      with funny little red walls 
      and roof of mossy green . ” 

 they gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the 
 branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground 
 was carpeted with moss . as they rattled up the little house they broke 
 into song themselves : 

      “ we 've built the little walls and roof 
      and made a lovely door , 
      so tell us , mother wendy , 
      what are you wanting more ? ” 

 to this she answered greedily : 

      “ oh , really next i think i 'll have 
      gay windows all about , 
      with roses peeping in , you know , 
      and babies peeping out . ” 

 with a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves 
 were the blinds . but roses-- ? 

 “ roses , ” cried peter sternly . 

 quickly they made - believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls . 

 babies ? 

 to prevent peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : 

      “ we 've made the roses peeping out , 
      the babes are at the door , 
      we can not make ourselves , you know , 
      'cos we 've been made before . ” 

 peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his 
 own . the house was quite beautiful , and no doubt wendy was very cosy 
 within , though , of course , they could no longer see her . peter strode 
 up and down , ordering finishing touches . nothing escaped his eagle eyes . 
 just when it seemed absolutely finished : 

 “ there 's no knocker on the door , ” he said . 

 they were very ashamed , but tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it 
 made an excellent knocker . 

 absolutely finished now , they thought . 

 not of bit of it . “ there 's no chimney , ” peter said ; “ we must have a 
 chimney . ” 

 “ it certainly does need a chimney , ” said john importantly . this gave 
 peter an idea . he snatched the hat off john 's head , knocked out the 
 bottom [ top ] , and put the hat on the roof . the little house was so 
 pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , 
 smoke immediately began to come out of the hat . 

 now really and truly it was finished . nothing remained to do but to 
 knock . 

 “ all look your best , ” peter warned them ; “ first impressions are awfully 
 important . ” 

 he was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all 
 too busy looking their best . 

 he knocked politely , and now the wood was as still as the children , not 
 a sound to be heard except from tinker bell , who was watching from a 
 branch and openly sneering . 

 what the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ? if a 
 lady , what would she be like ? 

 the door opened and a lady came out . it was wendy . they all whipped off 
 their hats . 

 she looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she 
 would look . 

 “ where am i ? ” she said . 

 of course slightly was the first to get his word in . “ wendy lady , ” he 
 said rapidly , “ for you we built this house . ” 

 “ oh , say you 're pleased , ” cried nibs . 

 “ lovely , darling house , ” wendy said , and they were the very words they 
 had hoped she would say . 

 “ and we are your children , ” cried the twins . 

 then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , “ o wendy 
 lady , be our mother . ” 

 “ ought i ? ” wendy said , all shining . “ of course it 's frightfully 
 fascinating , but you see i am only a little girl . i have no real 
 experience . ” 

 “ that does n't matter , ” said peter , as if he were the only person present 
 who knew all about it , though he was really the one who knew least . 
 “ what we need is just a nice motherly person . ” 

 “ oh dear ! ” wendy said , “ you see , i feel that is exactly what i am . ” 

 “ it is , it is , ” they all cried ; “ we saw it at once . ” 

 “ very well , ” she said , “ i will do my best . come inside at once , you 
 naughty children ; i am sure your feet are damp . and before i put you to 
 bed i have just time to finish the story of cinderella . ” 

 in they went ; i do n't know how there was room for them , but you can 
 squeeze very tight in the neverland . and that was the first of the many 
 joyous evenings they had with wendy . by and by she tucked them up in the 
 great bed in the home under the trees , but she herself slept that night 
 in the little house , and peter kept watch outside with drawn sword , for 
 the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the 
 prowl . the little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness , with 
 a bright light showing through its blinds , and the chimney smoking 
 beautifully , and peter standing on guard . after a time he fell asleep , 
 and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from 
 an orgy . any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they 
 would have mischiefed , but they just tweaked peter 's nose and passed on . 




 chapter 7 the home under the ground 

 one of the first things peter did next day was to measure wendy and john 
 and michael for hollow trees . hook , you remember , had sneered at the 
 boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece , but this was ignorance , for 
 unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down , and no 
 two of the boys were quite the same size . once you fitted , you drew in 
 [ let out ] your breath at the top , and down you went at exactly the 
 right speed , while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately , and so 
 wriggled up . of course , when you have mastered the action you are able 
 to do these things without thinking of them , and nothing can be more 
 graceful . 

 but you simply must fit , and peter measures you for your tree as 
 carefully as for a suit of clothes : the only difference being that the 
 clothes are made to fit you , while you have to be made to fit the tree . 
 usually it is done quite easily , as by your wearing too many garments 
 or too few , but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available 
 tree is an odd shape , peter does some things to you , and after that you 
 fit . once you fit , great care must be taken to go on fitting , and this , 
 as wendy was to discover to her delight , keeps a whole family in perfect 
 condition . 

 wendy and michael fitted their trees at the first try , but john had to 
 be altered a little . 

 after a few days ' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets 
 in a well . and how ardently they grew to love their home under the 
 ground ; especially wendy . it consisted of one large room , as all houses 
 should do , with a floor in which you could dig [ for worms ] if you wanted 
 to go fishing , and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming 
 colour , which were used as stools . a never tree tried hard to grow in 
 the centre of the room , but every morning they sawed the trunk through , 
 level with the floor . by tea - time it was always about two feet high , and 
 then they put a door on top of it , the whole thus becoming a table ; 
 as soon as they cleared away , they sawed off the trunk again , and thus 
 there was more room to play . there was an enormous fireplace which was 
 in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it , and across 
 this wendy stretched strings , made of fibre , from which she suspended 
 her washing . the bed was tilted against the wall by day , and let down at 
 6:30 , when it filled nearly half the room ; and all the boys slept in it , 
 except michael , lying like sardines in a tin . there was a strict rule 
 against turning round until one gave the signal , when all turned at 
 once . michael should have used it also , but wendy would have [ desired ] 
 a baby , and he was the littlest , and you know what women are , and the 
 short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket . 

 it was rough and simple , and not unlike what baby bears would have made 
 of an underground house in the same circumstances . but there was one 
 recess in the wall , no larger than a bird - cage , which was the private 
 apartment of tinker bell . it could be shut off from the rest of 
 the house by a tiny curtain , which tink , who was most fastidious 
 [ particular ] , always kept drawn when dressing or undressing . no woman , 
 however large , could have had a more exquisite boudoir [ dressing room ] 
 and bed - chamber combined . the couch , as she always called it , was 
 a genuine queen mab , with club legs ; and she varied the bedspreads 
 according to what fruit - blossom was in season . her mirror was a 
 puss - in - boots , of which there are now only three , unchipped , known to 
 fairy dealers ; the washstand was pie - crust and reversible , the chest 
 of drawers an authentic charming the sixth , and the carpet and rugs the 
 best ( the early ) period of margery and robin . there was a chandelier 
 from tiddlywinks for the look of the thing , but of course she lit the 
 residence herself . tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house , 
 as indeed was perhaps inevitable , and her chamber , though beautiful , 
 looked rather conceited , having the appearance of a nose permanently 
 turned up . 

 i suppose it was all especially entrancing to wendy , because those 
 rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do . really there were whole 
 weeks when , except perhaps with a stocking in the evening , she was never 
 above ground . the cooking , i can tell you , kept her nose to the pot , and 
 even if there was nothing in it , even if there was no pot , she had to 
 keep watching that it came aboil just the same . you never exactly 
 knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make - believe , it all 
 depended upon peter 's whim : he could eat , really eat , if it was part of 
 a game , but he could not stodge [ cram down the food ] just to feel 
 stodgy [ stuffed with food ] , which is what most children like better than 
 anything else ; the next best thing being to talk about it . make - believe 
 was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting 
 rounder . of course it was trying , but you simply had to follow his lead , 
 and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree 
 he let you stodge . 

 wendy 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all 
 gone to bed . then , as she expressed it , she had a breathing time for 
 herself ; and she occupied it in making new things for them , and putting 
 double pieces on the knees , for they were all most frightfully hard on 
 their knees . 

 when she sat down to a basketful of their stockings , every heel with a 
 hole in it , she would fling up her arms and exclaim , “ oh dear , i am sure 
 i sometimes think spinsters are to be envied ! ” 

 her face beamed when she exclaimed this . 

 you remember about her pet wolf . well , it very soon discovered that she 
 had come to the island and it found her out , and they just ran into each 
 other 's arms . after that it followed her about everywhere . 

 as time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had 
 left behind her ? this is a difficult question , because it is quite 
 impossible to say how time does wear on in the neverland , where it is 
 calculated by moons and suns , and there are ever so many more of them 
 than on the mainland . but i am afraid that wendy did not really worry 
 about her father and mother ; she was absolutely confident that they 
 would always keep the window open for her to fly back by , and this gave 
 her complete ease of mind . what did disturb her at times was that john 
 remembered his parents vaguely only , as people he had once known , while 
 michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother . 
 these things scared her a little , and nobly anxious to do her duty , she 
 tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination 
 papers on it , as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school . 
 the other boys thought this awfully interesting , and insisted on 
 joining , and they made slates for themselves , and sat round the table , 
 writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another 
 slate and passed round . they were the most ordinary questions--“what 
 was the colour of mother 's eyes ? which was taller , father or mother ? was 
 mother blonde or brunette ? answer all three questions if possible . ” 
  “ ( a ) write an essay of not less than 40 words on how i spent my last 
 holidays , or the characters of father and mother compared . only one of 
 these to be attempted . ” or “ ( 1 ) describe mother 's laugh ; ( 2 ) describe 
 father 's laugh ; ( 3 ) describe mother 's party dress ; ( 4 ) describe the 
 kennel and its inmate . ” 

 they were just everyday questions like these , and when you could not 
 answer them you were told to make a cross ; and it was really dreadful 
 what a number of crosses even john made . of course the only boy who 
 replied to every question was slightly , and no one could have been more 
 hopeful of coming out first , but his answers were perfectly ridiculous , 
 and he really came out last : a melancholy thing . 

 peter did not compete . for one thing he despised all mothers except 
 wendy , and for another he was the only boy on the island who could 
 neither write nor spell ; not the smallest word . he was above all that 
 sort of thing . 

 by the way , the questions were all written in the past tense . what 
 was the colour of mother 's eyes , and so on . wendy , you see , had been 
 forgetting , too . 

 adventures , of course , as we shall see , were of daily occurrence ; but 
 about this time peter invented , with wendy 's help , a new game that 
 fascinated him enormously , until he suddenly had no more interest in it , 
 which , as you have been told , was what always happened with his games . 
 it consisted in pretending not to have adventures , in doing the sort of 
 thing john and michael had been doing all their lives , sitting on stools 
 flinging balls in the air , pushing each other , going out for walks and 
 coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly . to see peter 
 doing nothing on a stool was a great sight ; he could not help looking 
 solemn at such times , to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to 
 do . he boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health . for 
 several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him ; and 
 john and michael had to pretend to be delighted also ; otherwise he would 
 have treated them severely . 

 he often went out alone , and when he came back you were never absolutely 
 certain whether he had had an adventure or not . he might have forgotten 
 it so completely that he said nothing about it ; and then when you went 
 out you found the body ; and , on the other hand , he might say a great 
 deal about it , and yet you could not find the body . sometimes he came 
 home with his head bandaged , and then wendy cooed over him and bathed 
 it in lukewarm water , while he told a dazzling tale . but she was never 
 quite sure , you know . there were , however , many adventures which she 
 knew to be true because she was in them herself , and there were still 
 more that were at least partly true , for the other boys were in them and 
 said they were wholly true . to describe them all would require a book as 
 large as an english - latin , latin - english dictionary , and the most we can 
 do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island . the 
 difficulty is which one to choose . should we take the brush with the 
 redskins at slightly gulch ? it was a sanguinary affair , and 
 especially interesting as showing one of peter 's peculiarities , which 
 was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides . at the 
 gulch , when victory was still in the balance , sometimes leaning this way 
 and sometimes that , he called out , “ i 'm redskin to - day ; what are you , 
 tootles ? ” and tootles answered , “ redskin ; what are you , nibs ? ” and 
 nibs said , “ redskin ; what are you twin ? ” and so on ; and they were all 
 redskins ; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real 
 redskins fascinated by peter 's methods , agreed to be lost boys for that 
 once , and so at it they all went again , more fiercely than ever . 

 the extraordinary upshot of this adventure was -- but we have not decided 
 yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate . perhaps a better one 
 would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground , 
 when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out 
 like corks . or we might tell how peter saved tiger lily 's life in the 
 mermaids ' lagoon , and so made her his ally . 

 or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might 
 eat it and perish ; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after 
 another ; but always wendy snatched it from the hands of her children , so 
 that in time it lost its succulence , and became as hard as a stone , and 
 was used as a missile , and hook fell over it in the dark . 

 or suppose we tell of the birds that were peter 's friends , particularly 
 of the never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon , and how 
 the nest fell into the water , and still the bird sat on her eggs , and 
 peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed . that is a pretty 
 story , and the end shows how grateful a bird can be ; but if we tell 
 it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon , which would 
 of course be telling two adventures rather than just one . a shorter 
 adventure , and quite as exciting , was tinker bell 's attempt , with the 
 help of some street fairies , to have the sleeping wendy conveyed on a 
 great floating leaf to the mainland . fortunately the leaf gave way and 
 wendy woke , thinking it was bath - time , and swam back . or again , we might 
 choose peter 's defiance of the lions , when he drew a circle round him 
 on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it ; and though he 
 waited for hours , with the other boys and wendy looking on breathlessly 
 from trees , not one of them dared to accept his challenge . 

 which of these adventures shall we choose ? the best way will be to toss 
 for it . 

 i have tossed , and the lagoon has won . this almost makes one wish that 
 the gulch or the cake or tink 's leaf had won . of course i could do it 
 again , and make it best out of three ; however , perhaps fairest to stick 
 to the lagoon . 




 chapter 8 the mermaids ' lagoon 

 if you shut your eyes and are a lucky one , you may see at times a 
 shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness ; then 
 if you squeeze your eyes tighter , the pool begins to take shape , and the 
 colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire . 
 but just before they go on fire you see the lagoon . this is the nearest 
 you ever get to it on the mainland , just one heavenly moment ; if there 
 could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids 
 singing . 

 the children often spent long summer days on this lagoon , swimming or 
 floating most of the time , playing the mermaid games in the water , 
 and so forth . you must not think from this that the mermaids were on 
 friendly terms with them : on the contrary , it was among wendy 's lasting 
 regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil 
 word from one of them . when she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon 
 she might see them by the score , especially on marooners ' rock , where 
 they loved to bask , combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite 
 irritated her ; or she might even swim , on tiptoe as it were , to within 
 a yard of them , but then they saw her and dived , probably splashing her 
 with their tails , not by accident , but intentionally . 

 they treated all the boys in the same way , except of course peter , who 
 chatted with them on marooners ' rock by the hour , and sat on their tails 
 when they got cheeky . he gave wendy one of their combs . 

 the most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon , 
 when they utter strange wailing cries ; but the lagoon is dangerous for 
 mortals then , and until the evening of which we have now to tell , wendy 
 had never seen the lagoon by moonlight , less from fear , for of course 
 peter would have accompanied her , than because she had strict rules 
 about every one being in bed by seven . she was often at the lagoon , 
 however , on sunny days after rain , when the mermaids come up in 
 extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles . the bubbles of many 
 colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls , hitting them gaily 
 from one to another with their tails , and trying to keep them in the 
 rainbow till they burst . the goals are at each end of the rainbow , and 
 the keepers only are allowed to use their hands . sometimes a dozen of 
 these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time , and it is quite a 
 pretty sight . 

 but the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by 
 themselves , for the mermaids immediately disappeared . nevertheless we 
 have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers , and were not 
 above taking an idea from them ; for john introduced a new way of hitting 
 the bubble , with the head instead of the hand , and the mermaids adopted 
 it . this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland . 

 it must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a 
 rock for half an hour after their mid - day meal . wendy insisted on 
 their doing this , and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was 
 make - believe . so they lay there in the sun , and their bodies glistened 
 in it , while she sat beside them and looked important . 

 it was one such day , and they were all on marooners ' rock . the rock was 
 not much larger than their great bed , but of course they all knew how 
 not to take up much room , and they were dozing , or at least lying with 
 their eyes shut , and pinching occasionally when they thought wendy was 
 not looking . she was very busy , stitching . 

 while she stitched a change came to the lagoon . little shivers ran over 
 it , and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water , turning 
 it cold . wendy could no longer see to thread her needle , and when she 
 looked up , the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing 
 place seemed formidable and unfriendly . 

 it was not , she knew , that night had come , but something as dark as 
 night had come . no , worse than that . it had not come , but it had sent 
 that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming . what was it ? 

 there crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of marooners ' 
 rock , so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave 
 them there to drown . they drown when the tide rises , for then it is 
 submerged . 

 of course she should have roused the children at once ; not merely 
 because of the unknown that was stalking toward them , but because it was 
 no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly . but she was 
 a young mother and she did not know this ; she thought you simply must 
 stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid - day meal . so , though 
 fear was upon her , and she longed to hear male voices , she would not 
 waken them . even when she heard the sound of muffled oars , though her 
 heart was in her mouth , she did not waken them . she stood over them to 
 let them have their sleep out . was it not brave of wendy ? 

 it was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could 
 sniff danger even in his sleep . peter sprang erect , as wide awake at 
 once as a dog , and with one warning cry he roused the others . 

 he stood motionless , one hand to his ear . 

 “ pirates ! ” he cried . the others came closer to him . a strange smile was 
 playing about his face , and wendy saw it and shuddered . while that smile 
 was on his face no one dared address him ; all they could do was to stand 
 ready to obey . the order came sharp and incisive . 

 “ dive ! ” 

 there was a gleam of legs , and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted . 
 marooners ' rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were 
 itself marooned . 

 the boat drew nearer . it was the pirate dinghy , with three figures in 
 her , smee and starkey , and the third a captive , no other than tiger 
 lily . her hands and ankles were tied , and she knew what was to be her 
 fate . she was to be left on the rock to perish , an end to one of her 
 race more terrible than death by fire or torture , for is it not written 
 in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the 
 happy hunting - ground ? yet her face was impassive ; she was the daughter 
 of a chief , she must die as a chief 's daughter , it is enough . 

 they had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth . 
 no watch was kept on the ship , it being hook 's boast that the wind of 
 his name guarded the ship for a mile around . now her fate would help to 
 guard it also . one more wail would go the round in that wind by night . 

 in the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the 
 rock till they crashed into it . 

 “ luff , you lubber , ” cried an irish voice that was smee 's ; “ here 's the 
 rock . now , then , what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and 
 leave her here to drown . ” 

 it was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the 
 rock ; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance . 

 quite near the rock , but out of sight , two heads were bobbing up and 
 down , peter 's and wendy 's . wendy was crying , for it was the first 
 tragedy she had seen . peter had seen many tragedies , but he had 
 forgotten them all . he was less sorry than wendy for tiger lily : it was 
 two against one that angered him , and he meant to save her . an easy way 
 would have been to wait until the pirates had gone , but he was never one 
 to choose the easy way . 

 there was almost nothing he could not do , and he now imitated the voice 
 of hook . 

 “ ahoy there , you lubbers ! ” he called . it was a marvellous imitation . 

 “ the captain ! ” said the pirates , staring at each other in surprise . 

 “ he must be swimming out to us , ” starkey said , when they had looked for 
 him in vain . 

 “ we are putting the redskin on the rock , ” smee called out . 

 “ set her free , ” came the astonishing answer . 

 “ free ! ” 

 “ yes , cut her bonds and let her go . ” 

 “ but , captain-- ” 

 “ at once , d'ye hear , ” cried peter , “ or i 'll plunge my hook in you . ” 

 “ this is queer ! ” smee gasped . 

 “ better do what the captain orders , ” said starkey nervously . 

 “ ay , ay , ” smee said , and he cut tiger lily 's cords . at once like an eel 
 she slid between starkey 's legs into the water . 

 of course wendy was very elated over peter 's cleverness ; but she knew 
 that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray 
 himself , so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth . but it was 
 stayed even in the act , for “ boat ahoy ! ” rang over the lagoon in hook 's 
 voice , and this time it was not peter who had spoken . 

 peter may have been about to crow , but his face puckered in a whistle of 
 surprise instead . 

 “ boat ahoy ! ” again came the voice . 

 now wendy understood . the real hook was also in the water . 

 he was swimming to the boat , and as his men showed a light to guide him 
 he had soon reached them . in the light of the lantern wendy saw his hook 
 grip the boat 's side ; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping 
 from the water , and , quaking , she would have liked to swim away , but 
 peter would not budge . he was tingling with life and also top - heavy with 
 conceit . “ am i not a wonder , oh , i am a wonder ! ” he whispered to her , 
 and though she thought so also , she was really glad for the sake of his 
 reputation that no one heard him except herself . 

 he signed to her to listen . 

 the two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain 
 to them , but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound 
 melancholy . 

 “ captain , is all well ? ” they asked timidly , but he answered with a 
 hollow moan . 

 “ he sighs , ” said smee . 

 “ he sighs again , ” said starkey . 

 “ and yet a third time he sighs , ” said smee . 

 then at last he spoke passionately . 

 “ the game 's up , ” he cried , “ those boys have found a mother . ” 

 affrighted though she was , wendy swelled with pride . 

 “ o evil day ! ” cried starkey . 

 “ what 's a mother ? ” asked the ignorant smee . 

 wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed . “ he does n't know ! ” and always 
 after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate smee would be 
 her one . 

 peter pulled her beneath the water , for hook had started up , crying , 
 “ what was that ? ” 

 “ i heard nothing , ” said starkey , raising the lantern over the waters , 
 and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight . it was the nest i 
 have told you of , floating on the lagoon , and the never bird was sitting 
 on it . 

 “ see , ” said hook in answer to smee 's question , “ that is a mother . what 
 a lesson ! the nest must have fallen into the water , but would the mother 
 desert her eggs ? no . ” 

 there was a break in his voice , as if for a moment he recalled innocent 
 days when -- but he brushed away this weakness with his hook . 

 smee , much impressed , gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past , but 
 the more suspicious starkey said , “ if she is a mother , perhaps she is 
 hanging about here to help peter . ” 

 hook winced . “ ay , ” he said , “ that is the fear that haunts me . ” 

 he was roused from this dejection by smee 's eager voice . 

 “ captain , ” said smee , “ could we not kidnap these boys ' mother and make 
 her our mother ? ” 

 “ it is a princely scheme , ” cried hook , and at once it took practical 
 shape in his great brain . “ we will seize the children and carry them to 
 the boat : the boys we will make walk the plank , and wendy shall be our 
 mother . ” 

 again wendy forgot herself . 

 “ never ! ” she cried , and bobbed . 

 “ what was that ? ” 

 but they could see nothing . they thought it must have been a leaf in the 
 wind . “ do you agree , my bullies ? ” asked hook . 

 “ there is my hand on it , ” they both said . 

 “ and there is my hook . swear . ” 

 they all swore . by this time they were on the rock , and suddenly hook 
 remembered tiger lily . 

 “ where is the redskin ? ” he demanded abruptly . 

 he had a playful humour at moments , and they thought this was one of the 
 moments . 

 “ that is all right , captain , ” smee answered complacently ; “ we let her 
 go . ” 

 “ let her go ! ” cried hook . 

 “ ' twas your own orders , ” the bo'sun faltered . 

 “ you called over the water to us to let her go , ” said starkey . 

 “ brimstone and gall , ” thundered hook , “ what cozening [ cheating ] is 
 going on here ! ” his face had gone black with rage , but he saw that they 
 believed their words , and he was startled . “ lads , ” he said , shaking a 
 little , “ i gave no such order . ” 

 “ it is passing queer , ” smee said , and they all fidgeted uncomfortably . 
 hook raised his voice , but there was a quiver in it . 

 “ spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to - night , ” he cried , “ dost hear 
 me ? ” 

 of course peter should have kept quiet , but of course he did not . he 
 immediately answered in hook 's voice : 

 “ odds , bobs , hammer and tongs , i hear you . ” 

 in that supreme moment hook did not blanch , even at the gills , but smee 
 and starkey clung to each other in terror . 

 “ who are you , stranger ? speak ! ” hook demanded . 

 “ i am james hook , ” replied the voice , “ captain of the jolly roger . ” 

 “ you are not ; you are not , ” hook cried hoarsely . 

 “ brimstone and gall , ” the voice retorted , “ say that again , and i 'll cast 
 anchor in you . ” 

 hook tried a more ingratiating manner . “ if you are hook , ” he said almost 
 humbly , “ come tell me , who am i ? ” 

 “ a codfish , ” replied the voice , “ only a codfish . ” 

 “ a codfish ! ” hook echoed blankly , and it was then , but not till then , 
 that his proud spirit broke . he saw his men draw back from him . 

 “ have we been captained all this time by a codfish ! ” they muttered . “ it 
 is lowering to our pride . ” 

 they were his dogs snapping at him , but , tragic figure though he had 
 become , he scarcely heeded them . against such fearful evidence it was 
 not their belief in him that he needed , it was his own . he felt his ego 
 slipping from him . “ do n't desert me , bully , ” he whispered hoarsely to 
 it . 

 in his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine , as in all the 
 great pirates , and it sometimes gave him intuitions . suddenly he tried 
 the guessing game . 

 “ hook , ” he called , “ have you another voice ? ” 

 now peter could never resist a game , and he answered blithely in his own 
 voice , “ i have . ” 

 “ and another name ? ” 

 “ ay , ay . ” 

 “ vegetable ? ” asked hook . 

 “ no . ” 

 “ mineral ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ animal ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ man ? ” 

 “ no ! ” this answer rang out scornfully . 

 “ boy ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ ordinary boy ? ” 

 “ no ! ” 

 “ wonderful boy ? ” 

 to wendy 's pain the answer that rang out this time was “ yes . ” 

 “ are you in england ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ are you here ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 hook was completely puzzled . “ you ask him some questions , ” he said to 
 the others , wiping his damp brow . 

 smee reflected . “ i ca n't think of a thing , ” he said regretfully . 

 “ ca n't guess , ca n't guess ! ” crowed peter . “ do you give it up ? ” 

 of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far , and the 
 miscreants [ villains ] saw their chance . 

 “ yes , yes , ” they answered eagerly . 

 “ well , then , ” he cried , “ i am peter pan . ” 

 pan ! 

 in a moment hook was himself again , and smee and starkey were his 
 faithful henchmen . 

 “ now we have him , ” hook shouted . “ into the water , smee . starkey , mind 
 the boat . take him dead or alive ! ” 

 he leaped as he spoke , and simultaneously came the gay voice of peter . 

 “ are you ready , boys ? ” 

 “ ay , ay , ” from various parts of the lagoon . 

 “ then lam into the pirates . ” 

 the fight was short and sharp . first to draw blood was john , who 
 gallantly climbed into the boat and held starkey . there was fierce 
 struggle , in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate 's grasp . he 
 wriggled overboard and john leapt after him . the dinghy drifted away . 

 here and there a head bobbed up in the water , and there was a flash 
 of steel followed by a cry or a whoop . in the confusion some struck at 
 their own side . the corkscrew of smee got tootles in the fourth rib , but 
 he was himself pinked [ nicked ] in turn by curly . farther from the rock 
 starkey was pressing slightly and the twins hard . 

 where all this time was peter ? he was seeking bigger game . 

 the others were all brave boys , and they must not be blamed for backing 
 from the pirate captain . his iron claw made a circle of dead water round 
 him , from which they fled like affrighted fishes . 

 but there was one who did not fear him : there was one prepared to enter 
 that circle . 

 strangely , it was not in the water that they met . hook rose to the rock 
 to breathe , and at the same moment peter scaled it on the opposite 
 side . the rock was slippery as a ball , and they had to crawl rather than 
 climb . neither knew that the other was coming . each feeling for a grip 
 met the other 's arm : in surprise they raised their heads ; their faces 
 were almost touching ; so they met . 

 some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to 
 [ began combat ] they had a sinking [ feeling in the stomach ] . had it been 
 so with peter at that moment i would admit it . after all , he was the 
 only man that the sea - cook had feared . but peter had no sinking , he had 
 one feeling only , gladness ; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy . 
 quick as thought he snatched a knife from hook 's belt and was about to 
 drive it home , when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe . 
 it would not have been fighting fair . he gave the pirate a hand to help 
 him up . 

 it was then that hook bit him . 

 not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed peter . it made 
 him quite helpless . he could only stare , horrified . every child is 
 affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly . all he thinks he 
 has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness . after 
 you have been unfair to him he will love you again , but will never 
 afterwards be quite the same boy . no one ever gets over the first 
 unfairness ; no one except peter . he often met it , but he always forgot 
 it . i suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest . 

 so when he met it now it was like the first time ; and he could just 
 stare , helpless . twice the iron hand clawed him . 

 a few moments afterwards the other boys saw hook in the water striking 
 wildly for the ship ; no elation on the pestilent face now , only white 
 fear , for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him . on ordinary 
 occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering ; but now they were 
 uneasy , for they had lost both peter and wendy , and were scouring the 
 lagoon for them , calling them by name . they found the dinghy and went 
 home in it , shouting “ peter , wendy ” as they went , but no answer came 
 save mocking laughter from the mermaids . “ they must be swimming back or 
 flying , ” the boys concluded . they were not very anxious , because they 
 had such faith in peter . they chuckled , boylike , because they would be 
 late for bed ; and it was all mother wendy 's fault ! 

 when their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon , and 
 then a feeble cry . 

 “ help , help ! ” 

 two small figures were beating against the rock ; the girl had fainted 
 and lay on the boy 's arm . with a last effort peter pulled her up the 
 rock and then lay down beside her . even as he also fainted he saw that 
 the water was rising . he knew that they would soon be drowned , but he 
 could do no more . 

 as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendy by the feet , and began 
 pulling her softly into the water . peter , feeling her slip from him , 
 woke with a start , and was just in time to draw her back . but he had to 
 tell her the truth . 

 “ we are on the rock , wendy , ” he said , “ but it is growing smaller . soon 
 the water will be over it . ” 

 she did not understand even now . 

 “ we must go , ” she said , almost brightly . 

 “ yes , ” he answered faintly . 

 “ shall we swim or fly , peter ? ” 

 he had to tell her . 

 “ do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island , wendy , without 
 my help ? ” 

 she had to admit that she was too tired . 

 he moaned . 

 “ what is it ? ” she asked , anxious about him at once . 

 “ i ca n't help you , wendy . hook wounded me . i can neither fly nor swim . ” 

 “ do you mean we shall both be drowned ? ” 

 “ look how the water is rising . ” 

 they put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight . they thought 
 they would soon be no more . as they sat thus something brushed against 
 peter as light as a kiss , and stayed there , as if saying timidly , “ can i 
 be of any use ? ” 

 it was the tail of a kite , which michael had made some days before . it 
 had torn itself out of his hand and floated away . 

 “ michael 's kite , ” peter said without interest , but next moment he had 
 seized the tail , and was pulling the kite toward him . 

 “ it lifted michael off the ground , ” he cried ; “ why should it not carry 
 you ? ” 

 “ both of us ! ” 

 “ it ca n't lift two ; michael and curly tried . ” 

 “ let us draw lots , ” wendy said bravely . 

 “ and you a lady ; never . ” already he had tied the tail round her . she 
 clung to him ; she refused to go without him ; but with a “ good - bye , 
 wendy , ” he pushed her from the rock ; and in a few minutes she was borne 
 out of his sight . peter was alone on the lagoon . 

 the rock was very small now ; soon it would be submerged . pale rays of 
 light tiptoed across the waters ; and by and by there was to be heard a 
 sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world : the 
 mermaids calling to the moon . 

 peter was not quite like other boys ; but he was afraid at last . a 
 tremour ran through him , like a shudder passing over the sea ; but on 
 the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them , and 
 peter felt just the one . next moment he was standing erect on the rock 
 again , with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him . it was 
 saying , “ to die will be an awfully big adventure . ” 




 chapter 9 the never bird 

 the last sound peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids 
 retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea . he was too far 
 away to hear their doors shut ; but every door in the coral caves where 
 they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes ( as in all the 
 nicest houses on the mainland ) , and he heard the bells . 

 steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet ; and to 
 pass the time until they made their final gulp , he watched the only 
 thing on the lagoon . he thought it was a piece of floating paper , 
 perhaps part of the kite , and wondered idly how long it would take to 
 drift ashore . 

 presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon 
 the lagoon with some definite purpose , for it was fighting the tide , 
 and sometimes winning ; and when it won , peter , always sympathetic to 
 the weaker side , could not help clapping ; it was such a gallant piece of 
 paper . 

 it was not really a piece of paper ; it was the never bird , making 
 desperate efforts to reach peter on the nest . by working her wings , in a 
 way she had learned since the nest fell into the water , she was able to 
 some extent to guide her strange craft , but by the time peter recognised 
 her she was very exhausted . she had come to save him , to give him her 
 nest , though there were eggs in it . i rather wonder at the bird , for 
 though he had been nice to her , he had also sometimes tormented her . i 
 can suppose only that , like mrs. darling and the rest of them , she was 
 melted because he had all his first teeth . 

 she called out to him what she had come for , and he called out to her 
 what she was doing there ; but of course neither of them understood 
 the other 's language . in fanciful stories people can talk to the birds 
 freely , and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a 
 story , and say that peter replied intelligently to the never bird ; but 
 truth is best , and i want to tell you only what really happened . well , 
 not only could they not understand each other , but they forgot their 
 manners . 

 “ i -- want -- you -- to -- get -- into -- the -- nest , ” the bird called , speaking as 
 slowly and distinctly as possible , “ and -- then -- you -- can -- drift -- ashore , 
 but -- i -- am -- too -- tired -- to -- bring -- it -- any -- nearer -- so -- you -- must -- try 
 to -- swim -- to -- it . ” 

 “ what are you quacking about ? ” peter answered . “ why do n't you let the 
 nest drift as usual ? ” 

 “ i -- want -- you-- ” the bird said , and repeated it all over . 

 then peter tried slow and distinct . 

 “ what -- are -- you -- quacking -- about ? ” and so on . 

 the never bird became irritated ; they have very short tempers . 

 “ you dunderheaded little jay ! ” she screamed , “ why do n't you do as i tell 
 you ? ” 

 peter felt that she was calling him names , and at a venture he retorted 
 hotly : 

 “ so are you ! ” 

 then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark : 

 “ shut up ! ” 

 “ shut up ! ” 

 nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could , and by 
 one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock . then up 
 she flew ; deserting her eggs , so as to make her meaning clear . 

 then at last he understood , and clutched the nest and waved his thanks 
 to the bird as she fluttered overhead . it was not to receive his thanks , 
 however , that she hung there in the sky ; it was not even to watch him 
 get into the nest ; it was to see what he did with her eggs . 

 there were two large white eggs , and peter lifted them up and reflected . 
 the bird covered her face with her wings , so as not to see the last of 
 them ; but she could not help peeping between the feathers . 

 i forget whether i have told you that there was a stave on the rock , 
 driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried 
 treasure . the children had discovered the glittering hoard , and when in 
 a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores , diamonds , pearls 
 and pieces of eight to the gulls , who pounced upon them for food , and 
 then flew away , raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon 
 them . the stave was still there , and on it starkey had hung his hat , a 
 deep tarpaulin , watertight , with a broad brim . peter put the eggs into 
 this hat and set it on the lagoon . it floated beautifully . 

 the never bird saw at once what he was up to , and screamed her 
 admiration of him ; and , alas , peter crowed his agreement with her . then 
 he got into the nest , reared the stave in it as a mast , and hung up his 
 shirt for a sail . at the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the 
 hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs . she drifted in one direction , 
 and he was borne off in another , both cheering . 

 of course when peter landed he beached his barque [ small ship , actually 
 the never bird 's nest in this particular case in point ] in a place where 
 the bird would easily find it ; but the hat was such a great success that 
 she abandoned the nest . it drifted about till it went to pieces , and 
 often starkey came to the shore of the lagoon , and with many bitter 
 feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat . as we shall not see her 
 again , it may be worth mentioning here that all never birds now build 
 in that shape of nest , with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an 
 airing . 

 great were the rejoicings when peter reached the home under the ground 
 almost as soon as wendy , who had been carried hither and thither by 
 the kite . every boy had adventures to tell ; but perhaps the biggest 
 adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed . this so 
 inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still 
 longer , such as demanding bandages ; but wendy , though glorying in having 
 them all home again safe and sound , was scandalised by the lateness of 
 the hour , and cried , “ to bed , to bed , ” in a voice that had to be obeyed . 
 next day , however , she was awfully tender , and gave out bandages to 
 every one , and they played till bed - time at limping about and carrying 
 their arms in slings . 




 chapter 10 the happy home 

 one important result of the brush [ with the pirates ] on the lagoon was 
 that it made the redskins their friends . peter had saved tiger lily from 
 a dreadful fate , and now there was nothing she and her braves would not 
 do for him . all night they sat above , keeping watch over the home under 
 the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously 
 could not be much longer delayed . even by day they hung about , smoking 
 the pipe of peace , and looking almost as if they wanted tit - bits to eat . 

 they called peter the great white father , prostrating themselves [ lying 
 down ] before him ; and he liked this tremendously , so that it was not 
 really good for him . 

 “ the great white father , ” he would say to them in a very lordly manner , 
 as they grovelled at his feet , “ is glad to see the piccaninny warriors 
 protecting his wigwam from the pirates . ” 

 “ me tiger lily , ” that lovely creature would reply . “ peter pan save me , 
 me his velly nice friend . me no let pirates hurt him . ” 

 she was far too pretty to cringe in this way , but peter thought it his 
 due , and he would answer condescendingly , “ it is good . peter pan has 
 spoken . ” 

 always when he said , “ peter pan has spoken , ” it meant that they must now 
 shut up , and they accepted it humbly in that spirit ; but they were by 
 no means so respectful to the other boys , whom they looked upon as just 
 ordinary braves . they said “ how - do ? ” to them , and things like that ; and 
 what annoyed the boys was that peter seemed to think this all right . 

 secretly wendy sympathised with them a little , but she was far too loyal 
 a housewife to listen to any complaints against father . “ father knows 
 best , ” she always said , whatever her private opinion must be . her 
 private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw . 

 we have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the 
 night of nights , because of its adventures and their upshot . the day , as 
 if quietly gathering its forces , had been almost uneventful , and now the 
 redskins in their blankets were at their posts above , while , below , the 
 children were having their evening meal ; all except peter , who had gone 
 out to get the time . the way you got the time on the island was to find 
 the crocodile , and then stay near him till the clock struck . 

 the meal happened to be a make - believe tea , and they sat around the 
 board , guzzling in their greed ; and really , what with their chatter and 
 recriminations , the noise , as wendy said , was positively deafening . 
 to be sure , she did not mind noise , but she simply would not have them 
 grabbing things , and then excusing themselves by saying that tootles had 
 pushed their elbow . there was a fixed rule that they must never hit back 
 at meals , but should refer the matter of dispute to wendy by raising 
 the right arm politely and saying , “ i complain of so - and - so ; ” but what 
 usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much . 

 “ silence , ” cried wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them 
 that they were not all to speak at once . “ is your mug empty , slightly 
 darling ? ” 

 “ not quite empty , mummy , ” slightly said , after looking into an imaginary 
 mug . 

 “ he has n't even begun to drink his milk , ” nibs interposed . 

 this was telling , and slightly seized his chance . 

 “ i complain of nibs , ” he cried promptly . 

 john , however , had held up his hand first . 

 “ well , john ? ” 

 “ may i sit in peter 's chair , as he is not here ? ” 

 “ sit in father 's chair , john ! ” wendy was scandalised . “ certainly not . ” 

 “ he is not really our father , ” john answered . “ he did n't even know how a 
 father does till i showed him . ” 

 this was grumbling . “ we complain of john , ” cried the twins . 

 tootles held up his hand . he was so much the humblest of them , indeed he 
 was the only humble one , that wendy was specially gentle with him . 

 “ i do n't suppose , ” tootles said diffidently [ bashfully or timidly ] , 
 “ that i could be father . ” 

 “ no , tootles . ” 

 once tootles began , which was not very often , he had a silly way of 
 going on . 

 “ as i ca n't be father , ” he said heavily , “ i do n't suppose , michael , you 
 would let me be baby ? ” 

 “ no , i wo n't , ” michael rapped out . he was already in his basket . 

 “ as i ca n't be baby , ” tootles said , getting heavier and heavier and 
 heavier , “ do you think i could be a twin ? ” 

 “ no , indeed , ” replied the twins ; “ it 's awfully difficult to be a twin . ” 

 “ as i ca n't be anything important , ” said tootles , “ would any of you like 
 to see me do a trick ? ” 

 “ no , ” they all replied . 

 then at last he stopped . “ i had n't really any hope , ” he said . 

 the hateful telling broke out again . 

 “ slightly is coughing on the table . ” 

 “ the twins began with cheese - cakes . ” 

 “ curly is taking both butter and honey . ” 

 “ nibs is speaking with his mouth full . ” 

 “ i complain of the twins . ” 

 “ i complain of curly . ” 

 “ i complain of nibs . ” 

 “ oh dear , oh dear , ” cried wendy , “ i 'm sure i sometimes think that 
 spinsters are to be envied . ” 

 she told them to clear away , and sat down to her work - basket , a heavy 
 load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual . 

 “ wendy , ” remonstrated [ scolded ] michael , “ i 'm too big for a cradle . ” 

 “ i must have somebody in a cradle , ” she said almost tartly , “ and you 
 are the littlest . a cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a 
 house . ” 

 while she sewed they played around her ; such a group of happy faces 
 and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire . it had become a very 
 familiar scene , this , in the home under the ground , but we are looking 
 on it for the last time . 

 there was a step above , and wendy , you may be sure , was the first to 
 recognize it . 

 “ children , i hear your father 's step . he likes you to meet him at the 
 door . ” 

 above , the redskins crouched before peter . 

 “ watch well , braves . i have spoken . ” 

 and then , as so often before , the gay children dragged him from his 
 tree . as so often before , but never again . 

 he had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for wendy . 

 “ peter , you just spoil them , you know , ” wendy simpered [ exaggerated a 
 smile ] . 

 “ ah , old lady , ” said peter , hanging up his gun . 

 “ it was me told him mothers are called old lady , ” michael whispered to 
 curly . 

 “ i complain of michael , ” said curly instantly . 

 the first twin came to peter . “ father , we want to dance . ” 

 “ dance away , my little man , ” said peter , who was in high good humour . 

 “ but we want you to dance . ” 

 peter was really the best dancer among them , but he pretended to be 
 scandalised . 

 “ me ! my old bones would rattle ! ” 

 “ and mummy too . ” 

 “ what , ” cried wendy , “ the mother of such an armful , dance ! ” 

 “ but on a saturday night , ” slightly insinuated . 

 it was not really saturday night , at least it may have been , for 
 they had long lost count of the days ; but always if they wanted to do 
 anything special they said this was saturday night , and then they did 
 it . 

 “ of course it is saturday night , peter , ” wendy said , relenting . 

 “ people of our figure , wendy ! ” 

 “ but it is only among our own progeny [ children ] . ” 

 “ true , true . ” 

 so they were told they could dance , but they must put on their nighties 
 first . 

 “ ah , old lady , ” peter said aside to wendy , warming himself by the fire 
 and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel , “ there is nothing 
 more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day 's toil is over 
 than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by . ” 

 “ it is sweet , peter , is n't it ? ” wendy said , frightfully gratified . 
 “ peter , i think curly has your nose . ” 

 “ michael takes after you . ” 

 she went to him and put her hand on his shoulder . 

 “ dear peter , ” she said , “ with such a large family , of course , i have now 
 passed my best , but you do n't want to [ ex]change me , do you ? ” 

 “ no , wendy . ” 

 certainly he did not want a change , but he looked at her uncomfortably , 
 blinking , you know , like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep . 

 “ peter , what is it ? ” 

 “ i was just thinking , ” he said , a little scared . “ it is only 
 make - believe , is n't it , that i am their father ? ” 

 “ oh yes , ” wendy said primly [ formally and properly ] . 

 “ you see , ” he continued apologetically , “ it would make me seem so old to 
 be their real father . ” 

 “ but they are ours , peter , yours and mine . ” 

 “ but not really , wendy ? ” he asked anxiously . 

 “ not if you do n't wish it , ” she replied ; and she distinctly heard his 
 sigh of relief . “ peter , ” she asked , trying to speak firmly , “ what are 
 your exact feelings to [ about ] me ? ” 

 “ those of a devoted son , wendy . ” 

 “ i thought so , ” she said , and went and sat by herself at the extreme end 
 of the room . 

 “ you are so queer , ” he said , frankly puzzled , “ and tiger lily is just 
 the same . there is something she wants to be to me , but she says it is 
 not my mother . ” 

 “ no , indeed , it is not , ” wendy replied with frightful emphasis . now we 
 know why she was prejudiced against the redskins . 

 “ then what is it ? ” 

 “ it is n't for a lady to tell . ” 

 “ oh , very well , ” peter said , a little nettled . “ perhaps tinker bell will 
 tell me . ” 

 “ oh yes , tinker bell will tell you , ” wendy retorted scornfully . “ she is 
 an abandoned little creature . ” 

 here tink , who was in her bedroom , eavesdropping , squeaked out something 
 impudent . 

 “ she says she glories in being abandoned , ” peter interpreted . 

 he had a sudden idea . “ perhaps tink wants to be my mother ? ” 

 “ you silly ass ! ” cried tinker bell in a passion . 

 she had said it so often that wendy needed no translation . 

 “ i almost agree with her , ” wendy snapped . fancy wendy snapping ! but she 
 had been much tried , and she little knew what was to happen before the 
 night was out . if she had known she would not have snapped . 

 none of them knew . perhaps it was best not to know . their ignorance 
 gave them one more glad hour ; and as it was to be their last hour on the 
 island , let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it . they 
 sang and danced in their night - gowns . such a deliciously creepy song 
 it was , in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows , 
 little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them , from whom 
 they would shrink in real fear . so uproariously gay was the dance , and 
 how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it ! it was a pillow 
 fight rather than a dance , and when it was finished , the pillows 
 insisted on one bout more , like partners who know that they may never 
 meet again . the stories they told , before it was time for wendy 's 
 good - night story ! even slightly tried to tell a story that night , but 
 the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others 
 but himself , and he said gloomily : 

 “ yes , it is a dull beginning . i say , let us pretend that it is the end . ” 

 and then at last they all got into bed for wendy 's story , the story they 
 loved best , the story peter hated . usually when she began to tell this 
 story he left the room or put his hands over his ears ; and possibly if 
 he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on 
 the island . but to - night he remained on his stool ; and we shall see what 
 happened . 




 chapter 11 wendy 's story 

 “ listen , then , ” said wendy , settling down to her story , with michael at 
 her feet and seven boys in the bed . “ there was once a gentleman-- ” 

 “ i had rather he had been a lady , ” curly said . 

 “ i wish he had been a white rat , ” said nibs . 

 “ quiet , ” their mother admonished [ cautioned ] them . “ there was a lady 
 also , and-- ” 

 “ oh , mummy , ” cried the first twin , “ you mean that there is a lady also , 
 do n't you ? she is not dead , is she ? ” 

 “ oh , no . ” 

 “ i am awfully glad she is n't dead , ” said tootles . “ are you glad , john ? ” 

 “ of course i am . ” 

 “ are you glad , nibs ? ” 

 “ rather . ” 

 “ are you glad , twins ? ” 

 “ we are glad . ” 

 “ oh dear , ” sighed wendy . 

 “ little less noise there , ” peter called out , determined that she should 
 have fair play , however beastly a story it might be in his opinion . 

 “ the gentleman 's name , ” wendy continued , “ was mr. darling , and her name 
 was mrs. darling . ” 

 “ i knew them , ” john said , to annoy the others . 

 “ i think i knew them , ” said michael rather doubtfully . 

 “ they were married , you know , ” explained wendy , “ and what do you think 
 they had ? ” 

 “ white rats , ” cried nibs , inspired . 

 “ no . ” 

 “ it 's awfully puzzling , ” said tootles , who knew the story by heart . 

 “ quiet , tootles . they had three descendants . ” 

 “ what is descendants ? ” 

 “ well , you are one , twin . ” 

 “ did you hear that , john ? i am a descendant . ” 

 “ descendants are only children , ” said john . 

 “ oh dear , oh dear , ” sighed wendy . “ now these three children had a 
 faithful nurse called nana ; but mr. darling was angry with her and 
 chained her up in the yard , and so all the children flew away . ” 

 “ it 's an awfully good story , ” said nibs . 

 “ they flew away , ” wendy continued , “ to the neverland , where the lost 
 children are . ” 

 “ i just thought they did , ” curly broke in excitedly . “ i do n't know how 
 it is , but i just thought they did ! ” 

 “ o wendy , ” cried tootles , “ was one of the lost children called tootles ? ” 

 “ yes , he was . ” 

 “ i am in a story . hurrah , i am in a story , nibs . ” 

 “ hush . now i want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents 
 with all their children flown away . ” 

 “ oo ! ” they all moaned , though they were not really considering the 
 feelings of the unhappy parents one jot . 

 “ think of the empty beds ! ” 

 “ oo ! ” 

 “ it 's awfully sad , ” the first twin said cheerfully . 

 “ i do n't see how it can have a happy ending , ” said the second twin . “ do 
 you , nibs ? ” 

 “ i 'm frightfully anxious . ” 

 “ if you knew how great is a mother 's love , ” wendy told them 
 triumphantly , “ you would have no fear . ” she had now come to the part 
 that peter hated . 

 “ i do like a mother 's love , ” said tootles , hitting nibs with a pillow . 
 “ do you like a mother 's love , nibs ? ” 

 “ i do just , ” said nibs , hitting back . 

 “ you see , ” wendy said complacently , “ our heroine knew that the mother 
 would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by ; so 
 they stayed away for years and had a lovely time . ” 

 “ did they ever go back ? ” 

 “ let us now , ” said wendy , bracing herself up for her finest effort , 
 “ take a peep into the future ; ” and they all gave themselves the twist 
 that makes peeps into the future easier . “ years have rolled by , and who 
 is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at london station ? ” 

 “ o wendy , who is she ? ” cried nibs , every bit as excited as if he did n't 
 know . 

 “ can it be -- yes -- no -- it is -- the fair wendy ! ” 

 “ oh ! ” 

 “ and who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her , now grown to 
 man 's estate ? can they be john and michael ? they are ! ” 

 “ oh ! ” 

 “ ' see , dear brothers , ' says wendy pointing upwards , ' there is the window 
 still standing open . ah , now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a 
 mother 's love . ' so up they flew to their mummy and daddy , and pen can not 
 describe the happy scene , over which we draw a veil . ” 

 that was the story , and they were as pleased with it as the fair 
 narrator herself . everything just as it should be , you see . off we skip 
 like the most heartless things in the world , which is what children are , 
 but so attractive ; and we have an entirely selfish time , and then when 
 we have need of special attention we nobly return for it , confident that 
 we shall be rewarded instead of smacked . 

 so great indeed was their faith in a mother 's love that they felt they 
 could afford to be callous for a bit longer . 

 but there was one there who knew better , and when wendy finished he 
 uttered a hollow groan . 

 “ what is it , peter ? ” she cried , running to him , thinking he was ill . she 
 felt him solicitously , lower down than his chest . “ where is it , peter ? ” 

 “ it is n't that kind of pain , ” peter replied darkly . 

 “ then what kind is it ? ” 

 “ wendy , you are wrong about mothers . ” 

 they all gathered round him in affright , so alarming was his agitation ; 
 and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed . 

 “ long ago , ” he said , “ i thought like you that my mother would always 
 keep the window open for me , so i stayed away for moons and moons and 
 moons , and then flew back ; but the window was barred , for mother had 
 forgotten all about me , and there was another little boy sleeping in my 
 bed . ” 

 i am not sure that this was true , but peter thought it was true ; and it 
 scared them . 

 “ are you sure mothers are like that ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 so this was the truth about mothers . the toads ! 

 still it is best to be careful ; and no one knows so quickly as a child 
 when he should give in . “ wendy , let us [ let 's ] go home , ” cried john and 
 michael together . 

 “ yes , ” she said , clutching them . 

 “ not to - night ? ” asked the lost boys bewildered . they knew in what they 
 called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother , and 
 that it is only the mothers who think you ca n't . 

 “ at once , ” wendy replied resolutely , for the horrible thought had come 
 to her : “ perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time . ” 

 this dread made her forgetful of what must be peter 's feelings , and 
 she said to him rather sharply , “ peter , will you make the necessary 
 arrangements ? ” 

 “ if you wish it , ” he replied , as coolly as if she had asked him to pass 
 the nuts . 

 not so much as a sorry - to - lose - you between them ! if she did not mind the 
 parting , he was going to show her , was peter , that neither did he . 

 but of course he cared very much ; and he was so full of wrath against 
 grown - ups , who , as usual , were spoiling everything , that as soon as he 
 got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the 
 rate of about five to a second . he did this because there is a saying in 
 the neverland that , every time you breathe , a grown - up dies ; and peter 
 was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible . 

 then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned 
 to the home , where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence . 
 panic - stricken at the thought of losing wendy the lost boys had advanced 
 upon her threateningly . 

 “ it will be worse than before she came , ” they cried . 

 “ we sha n't let her go . ” 

 “ let 's keep her prisoner . ” 

 “ ay , chain her up . ” 

 in her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn . 

 “ tootles , ” she cried , “ i appeal to you . ” 

 was it not strange ? she appealed to tootles , quite the silliest one . 

 grandly , however , did tootles respond . for that one moment he dropped 
 his silliness and spoke with dignity . 

 “ i am just tootles , ” he said , “ and nobody minds me . but the first who 
 does not behave to wendy like an english gentleman i will blood him 
 severely . ” 

 he drew back his hanger ; and for that instant his sun was at noon . the 
 others held back uneasily . then peter returned , and they saw at once 
 that they would get no support from him . he would keep no girl in the 
 neverland against her will . 

 “ wendy , ” he said , striding up and down , “ i have asked the redskins to 
 guide you through the wood , as flying tires you so . ” 

 “ thank you , peter . ” 

 “ then , ” he continued , in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be 
 obeyed , “ tinker bell will take you across the sea . wake her , nibs . ” 

 nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer , though tink had really 
 been sitting up in bed listening for some time . 

 “ who are you ? how dare you ? go away , ” she cried . 

 “ you are to get up , tink , ” nibs called , “ and take wendy on a journey . ” 

 of course tink had been delighted to hear that wendy was going ; but 
 she was jolly well determined not to be her courier , and she said so in 
 still more offensive language . then she pretended to be asleep again . 

 “ she says she wo n't ! ” nibs exclaimed , aghast at such insubordination , 
 whereupon peter went sternly toward the young lady 's chamber . 

 “ tink , ” he rapped out , “ if you do n't get up and dress at once i will 
 open the curtains , and then we shall all see you in your negligee 
 [ nightgown ] . ” 

 this made her leap to the floor . “ who said i was n't getting up ? ” she 
 cried . 

 in the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at wendy , now 
 equipped with john and michael for the journey . by this time they were 
 dejected , not merely because they were about to lose her , but also 
 because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they 
 had not been invited . novelty was beckoning to them as usual . 

 crediting them with a nobler feeling wendy melted . 

 “ dear ones , ” she said , “ if you will all come with me i feel almost sure 
 i can get my father and mother to adopt you . ” 

 the invitation was meant specially for peter , but each of the boys was 
 thinking exclusively of himself , and at once they jumped with joy . 

 “ but wo n't they think us rather a handful ? ” nibs asked in the middle of 
 his jump . 

 “ oh no , ” said wendy , rapidly thinking it out , “ it will only mean having 
 a few beds in the drawing - room ; they can be hidden behind the screens on 
 first thursdays . ” 

 “ peter , can we go ? ” they all cried imploringly . they took it for granted 
 that if they went he would go also , but really they scarcely cared . thus 
 children are ever ready , when novelty knocks , to desert their dearest 
 ones . 

 “ all right , ” peter replied with a bitter smile , and immediately they 
 rushed to get their things . 

 “ and now , peter , ” wendy said , thinking she had put everything right , 
 “ i am going to give you your medicine before you go . ” she loved to give 
 them medicine , and undoubtedly gave them too much . of course it was only 
 water , but it was out of a bottle , and she always shook the bottle and 
 counted the drops , which gave it a certain medicinal quality . on this 
 occasion , however , she did not give peter his draught [ portion ] , for 
 just as she had prepared it , she saw a look on his face that made her 
 heart sink . 

 “ get your things , peter , ” she cried , shaking . 

 “ no , ” he answered , pretending indifference , “ i am not going with you , 
 wendy . ” 

 “ yes , peter . ” 

 “ no . ” 

 to show that her departure would leave him unmoved , he skipped up and 
 down the room , playing gaily on his heartless pipes . she had to run 
 about after him , though it was rather undignified . 

 “ to find your mother , ” she coaxed . 

 now , if peter had ever quite had a mother , he no longer missed her . he 
 could do very well without one . he had thought them out , and remembered 
 only their bad points . 

 “ no , no , ” he told wendy decisively ; “ perhaps she would say i was old , 
 and i just want always to be a little boy and to have fun . ” 

 “ but , peter-- ” 

 “ no . ” 

 and so the others had to be told . 

 “ peter is n't coming . ” 

 peter not coming ! they gazed blankly at him , their sticks over their 
 backs , and on each stick a bundle . their first thought was that if peter 
 was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go . 

 but he was far too proud for that . “ if you find your mothers , ” he said 
 darkly , “ i hope you will like them . ” 

 the awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression , and most 
 of them began to look rather doubtful . after all , their faces said , were 
 they not noodles to want to go ? 

 “ now then , ” cried peter , “ no fuss , no blubbering ; good - bye , wendy ; ” and 
 he held out his hand cheerily , quite as if they must really go now , for 
 he had something important to do . 

 she had to take his hand , and there was no indication that he would 
 prefer a thimble . 

 “ you will remember about changing your flannels , peter ? ” she said , 
 lingering over him . she was always so particular about their flannels . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ and you will take your medicine ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 that seemed to be everything , and an awkward pause followed . peter , 
 however , was not the kind that breaks down before other people . “ are you 
 ready , tinker bell ? ” he called out . 

 “ ay , ay . ” 

 “ then lead the way . ” 

 tink darted up the nearest tree ; but no one followed her , for it was 
 at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the 
 redskins . above , where all had been so still , the air was rent with 
 shrieks and the clash of steel . below , there was dead silence . mouths 
 opened and remained open . wendy fell on her knees , but her arms were 
 extended toward peter . all arms were extended to him , as if suddenly 
 blown in his direction ; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert 
 them . as for peter , he seized his sword , the same he thought he had 
 slain barbecue with , and the lust of battle was in his eye . 




 chapter 12 the children are carried off 

 the pirate attack had been a complete surprise : a sure proof that the 
 unscrupulous hook had conducted it improperly , for to surprise redskins 
 fairly is beyond the wit of the white man . 

 by all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who 
 attacks , and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the 
 dawn , at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its 
 lowest ebb . the white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on 
 the summit of yonder undulating ground , at the foot of which a stream 
 runs , for it is destruction to be too far from water . there they await 
 the onslaught , the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and 
 treading on twigs , but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just 
 before the dawn . through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle , 
 snake - like , among the grass without stirring a blade . the brushwood 
 closes behind them , as silently as sand into which a mole has dived . 
 not a sound is to be heard , save when they give vent to a wonderful 
 imitation of the lonely call of the coyote . the cry is answered by other 
 braves ; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes , who are not 
 very good at it . so the chill hours wear on , and the long suspense is 
 horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first 
 time ; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier 
 silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching . 

 that this was the usual procedure was so well known to hook that in 
 disregarding it he can not be excused on the plea of ignorance . 

 the piccaninnies , on their part , trusted implicitly to his honour , and 
 their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his . 
 they left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of 
 their tribe . with that alertness of the senses which is at once the 
 marvel and despair of civilised peoples , they knew that the pirates were 
 on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick ; and in 
 an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began . every foot of 
 ground between the spot where hook had landed his forces and the 
 home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their 
 mocassins with the heels in front . they found only one hillock with a 
 stream at its base , so that hook had no choice ; here he must establish 
 himself and wait for just before the dawn . everything being thus mapped 
 out with almost diabolical cunning , the main body of the redskins folded 
 their blankets around them , and in the phlegmatic manner that is to 
 them , the pearl of manhood squatted above the children 's home , awaiting 
 the cold moment when they should deal pale death . 

 here dreaming , though wide - awake , of the exquisite tortures to which 
 they were to put him at break of day , those confiding savages were found 
 by the treacherous hook . from the accounts afterwards supplied by such 
 of the scouts as escaped the carnage , he does not seem even to have 
 paused at the rising ground , though it is certain that in that grey 
 light he must have seen it : no thought of waiting to be attacked appears 
 from first to last to have visited his subtle mind ; he would not even 
 hold off till the night was nearly spent ; on he pounded with no policy 
 but to fall to [ get into combat ] . what could the bewildered scouts do , 
 masters as they were of every war - like artifice save this one , but trot 
 helplessly after him , exposing themselves fatally to view , while they 
 gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry . 

 around the brave tiger lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors , and 
 they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them . fell 
 from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at 
 victory . no more would they torture at the stake . for them the happy 
 hunting - grounds was now . they knew it ; but as their father 's sons they 
 acquitted themselves . even then they had time to gather in a phalanx 
 [ dense formation ] that would have been hard to break had they risen 
 quickly , but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their 
 race . it is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in 
 the presence of the white . thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the 
 pirates must have been to them , they remained stationary for a moment , 
 not a muscle moving ; as if the foe had come by invitation . then , indeed , 
 the tradition gallantly upheld , they seized their weapons , and the air 
 was torn with the war - cry ; but it was now too late . 

 it is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a 
 fight . thus perished many of the flower of the piccaninny tribe . not all 
 unavenged did they die , for with lean wolf fell alf mason , to disturb 
 the spanish main no more , and among others who bit the dust were geo . 
 scourie , chas . turley , and the alsatian foggerty . turley fell to the 
 tomahawk of the terrible panther , who ultimately cut a way through the 
 pirates with tiger lily and a small remnant of the tribe . 

 to what extent hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for 
 the historian to decide . had he waited on the rising ground till the 
 proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered ; and in 
 judging him it is only fair to take this into account . what he should 
 perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to 
 follow a new method . on the other hand , this , as destroying the element 
 of surprise , would have made his strategy of no avail , so that the whole 
 question is beset with difficulties . one can not at least withhold a 
 reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme , 
 and the fell [ deadly ] genius with which it was carried out . 

 what were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment ? 
 fain [ gladly ] would his dogs have known , as breathing heavily and wiping 
 their cutlasses , they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook , and 
 squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man . elation 
 must have been in his heart , but his face did not reflect it : ever a 
 dark and solitary enigma , he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as 
 in substance . 

 the night 's work was not yet over , for it was not the redskins he had 
 come out to destroy ; they were but the bees to be smoked , so that he 
 should get at the honey . it was pan he wanted , pan and wendy and their 
 band , but chiefly pan . 

 peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man 's hatred 
 of him . true he had flung hook 's arm to the crocodile , but even this 
 and the increased insecurity of life to which it led , owing to 
 the crocodile 's pertinacity [ persistance ] , hardly account for a 
 vindictiveness so relentless and malignant . the truth is that there was 
 a something about peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy . it 
 was not his courage , it was not his engaging appearance , it was not-- . 
 there is no beating about the bush , for we know quite well what it was , 
 and have got to tell . it was peter 's cockiness . 

 this had got on hook 's nerves ; it made his iron claw twitch , and at 
 night it disturbed him like an insect . while peter lived , the tortured 
 man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come . 

 the question now was how to get down the trees , or how to get his dogs 
 down ? he ran his greedy eyes over them , searching for the thinnest 
 ones . they wriggled uncomfortably , for they knew he would not scruple 
 [ hesitate ] to ram them down with poles . 

 in the meantime , what of the boys ? we have seen them at the first clang 
 of the weapons , turned as it were into stone figures , open - mouthed , 
 all appealing with outstretched arms to peter ; and we return to them as 
 their mouths close , and their arms fall to their sides . the pandemonium 
 above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose , passed like a fierce 
 gust of wind ; but they know that in the passing it has determined their 
 fate . 

 which side had won ? 

 the pirates , listening avidly at the mouths of the trees , heard the 
 question put by every boy , and alas , they also heard peter 's answer . 

 “ if the redskins have won , ” he said , “ they will beat the tom - tom ; it is 
 always their sign of victory . ” 

 now smee had found the tom - tom , and was at that moment sitting on it . 
 “ you will never hear the tom - tom again , ” he muttered , but inaudibly of 
 course , for strict silence had been enjoined [ urged ] . to his amazement 
 hook signed him to beat the tom - tom , and slowly there came to smee an 
 understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order . never , probably , 
 had this simple man admired hook so much . 

 twice smee beat upon the instrument , and then stopped to listen 
 gleefully . 

 “ the tom - tom , ” the miscreants heard peter cry ; “ an indian victory ! ” 

 the doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black 
 hearts above , and almost immediately they repeated their good - byes 
 to peter . this puzzled the pirates , but all their other feelings were 
 swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the 
 trees . they smirked at each other and rubbed their hands . rapidly and 
 silently hook gave his orders : one man to each tree , and the others to 
 arrange themselves in a line two yards apart . 




 chapter 13 do you believe in fairies ? 

 the more quickly this horror is disposed of the better . the first to 
 emerge from his tree was curly . he rose out of it into the arms of 
 cecco , who flung him to smee , who flung him to starkey , who flung him to 
 bill jukes , who flung him to noodler , and so he was tossed from one to 
 another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate . all the boys were 
 plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner ; and several of them 
 were in the air at a time , like bales of goods flung from hand to hand . 

 a different treatment was accorded to wendy , who came last . with 
 ironical politeness hook raised his hat to her , and , offering her his 
 arm , escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged . he 
 did it with such an air , he was so frightfully distingue [ imposingly 
 distinguished ] , that she was too fascinated to cry out . she was only a 
 little girl . 

 perhaps it is tell - tale to divulge that for a moment hook entranced her , 
 and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results . had she 
 haughtily unhanded him ( and we should have loved to write it of her ) , 
 she would have been hurled through the air like the others , and then 
 hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children ; 
 and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered slightly 's 
 secret , and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul 
 attempt on peter 's life . 

 they were tied to prevent their flying away , doubled up with their knees 
 close to their ears ; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had 
 cut a rope into nine equal pieces . all went well until slightly 's turn 
 came , when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up 
 all the string in going round and leave no tags [ ends ] with which to 
 tie a knot . the pirates kicked him in their rage , just as you kick the 
 parcel ( though in fairness you should kick the string ) ; and strange 
 to say it was hook who told them to belay their violence . his lip was 
 curled with malicious triumph . while his dogs were merely sweating 
 because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one 
 part he bulged out in another , hook 's master mind had gone far beneath 
 slightly 's surface , probing not for effects but for causes ; and his 
 exultation showed that he had found them . slightly , white to the gills , 
 knew that hook had surprised [ discovered ] his secret , which was this , 
 that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need 
 stick . poor slightly , most wretched of all the children now , for he 
 was in a panic about peter , bitterly regretted what he had done . madly 
 addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot , he had swelled in 
 consequence to his present girth , and instead of reducing himself to fit 
 his tree he had , unknown to the others , whittled his tree to make it fit 
 him . 

 sufficient of this hook guessed to persuade him that peter at last lay 
 at his mercy , but no word of the dark design that now formed in the 
 subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips ; he merely signed 
 that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship , and that he would be 
 alone . 

 how to convey them ? hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be 
 rolled down hill like barrels , but most of the way lay through a morass . 
 again hook 's genius surmounted difficulties . he indicated that the 
 little house must be used as a conveyance . the children were flung into 
 it , four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders , the others fell in 
 behind , and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession 
 set off through the wood . i do n't know whether any of the children were 
 crying ; if so , the singing drowned the sound ; but as the little house 
 disappeared in the forest , a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from 
 its chimney as if defying hook . 

 hook saw it , and it did peter a bad service . it dried up any trickle of 
 pity for him that may have remained in the pirate 's infuriated breast . 

 the first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling 
 night was to tiptoe to slightly 's tree , and make sure that it provided 
 him with a passage . then for long he remained brooding ; his hat of ill 
 omen on the sward , so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play 
 refreshingly through his hair . dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes 
 were as soft as the periwinkle . intently he listened for any sound from 
 the nether world , but all was as silent below as above ; the house under 
 the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void . was 
 that boy asleep , or did he stand waiting at the foot of slightly 's tree , 
 with his dagger in his hand ? 

 there was no way of knowing , save by going down . hook let his cloak slip 
 softly to the ground , and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood 
 on them , he stepped into the tree . he was a brave man , but for a moment 
 he had to stop there and wipe his brow , which was dripping like a 
 candle . then , silently , he let himself go into the unknown . 

 he arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft , and stood still again , 
 biting at his breath , which had almost left him . as his eyes became 
 accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees 
 took shape ; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested , long 
 sought for and found at last , was the great bed . on the bed lay peter 
 fast asleep . 

 unaware of the tragedy being enacted above , peter had continued , for 
 a little time after the children left , to play gaily on his pipes : no 
 doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care . 
 then he decided not to take his medicine , so as to grieve wendy . then he 
 lay down on the bed outside the coverlet , to vex her still more ; for she 
 had always tucked them inside it , because you never know that you may 
 not grow chilly at the turn of the night . then he nearly cried ; but 
 it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead ; so he 
 laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it . 

 sometimes , though not often , he had dreams , and they were more painful 
 than the dreams of other boys . for hours he could not be separated from 
 these dreams , though he wailed piteously in them . they had to do , i 
 think , with the riddle of his existence . at such times it had been 
 wendy 's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap , 
 soothing him in dear ways of her own invention , and when he grew calmer 
 to put him back to bed before he quite woke up , so that he should 
 not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him . but on this 
 occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep . one arm dropped 
 over the edge of the bed , one leg was arched , and the unfinished part of 
 his laugh was stranded on his mouth , which was open , showing the little 
 pearls . 

 thus defenceless hook found him . he stood silent at the foot of the tree 
 looking across the chamber at his enemy . did no feeling of compassion 
 disturb his sombre breast ? the man was not wholly evil ; he loved flowers 
 ( i have been told ) and sweet music ( he was himself no mean performer on 
 the harpsichord ) ; and , let it be frankly admitted , the idyllic nature of 
 the scene stirred him profoundly . mastered by his better self he would 
 have returned reluctantly up the tree , but for one thing . 

 what stayed him was peter 's impertinent appearance as he slept . the 
 open mouth , the drooping arm , the arched knee : they were such a 
 personification of cockiness as , taken together , will never again , one 
 may hope , be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness . they 
 steeled hook 's heart . if his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces 
 every one of them would have disregarded the incident , and leapt at the 
 sleeper . 

 though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed , hook stood in 
 darkness himself , and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered 
 an obstacle , the door of slightly 's tree . it did not entirely fill the 
 aperture , and he had been looking over it . feeling for the catch , 
 he found to his fury that it was low down , beyond his reach . to his 
 disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in peter 's 
 face and figure visibly increased , and he rattled the door and flung 
 himself against it . was his enemy to escape him after all ? 

 but what was that ? the red in his eye had caught sight of peter 's 
 medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach . he fathomed what it was 
 straightaway , and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power . 

 lest he should be taken alive , hook always carried about his person a 
 dreadful drug , blended by himself of all the death - dealing rings that 
 had come into his possession . these he had boiled down into a yellow 
 liquid quite unknown to science , which was probably the most virulent 
 poison in existence . 

 five drops of this he now added to peter 's cup . his hand shook , but it 
 was in exultation rather than in shame . as he did it he avoided glancing 
 at the sleeper , but not lest pity should unnerve him ; merely to avoid 
 spilling . then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim , and 
 turning , wormed his way with difficulty up the tree . as he emerged 
 at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole . 
 donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , 
 holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , 
 of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , 
 stole away through the trees . 

 peter slept on . the light guttered [ burned to edges ] and went out , 
 leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept . it must have been 
 not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in 
 his bed , wakened by he knew not what . it was a soft cautious tapping on 
 the door of his tree . 

 soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister . peter felt for 
 his dagger till his hand gripped it . then he spoke . 

 “ who is that ? ” 

 for long there was no answer : then again the knock . 

 “ who are you ? ” 

 no answer . 

 he was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled . in two strides he reached 
 the door . unlike slightly 's door , it filled the aperture [ opening ] , so 
 that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him . 

 “ i wo n't open unless you speak , ” peter cried . 

 then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell - like voice . 

 “ let me in , peter . ” 

 it was tink , and quickly he unbarred to her . she flew in excitedly , her 
 face flushed and her dress stained with mud . 

 “ what is it ? ” 

 “ oh , you could never guess ! ” she cried , and offered him three guesses . 
 “ out with it ! ” he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as 
 the ribbons that conjurers [ magicians ] pull from their mouths , she told 
 of the capture of wendy and the boys . 

 peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened . wendy bound , and on the 
 pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so ! 

 “ i 'll rescue her ! ” he cried , leaping at his weapons . as he leapt he 
 thought of something he could do to please her . he could take his 
 medicine . 

 his hand closed on the fatal draught . 

 “ no ! ” shrieked tinker bell , who had heard hook mutter about his deed as 
 he sped through the forest . 

 “ why not ? ” 

 “ it is poisoned . ” 

 “ poisoned ? who could have poisoned it ? ” 

 “ hook . ” 

 “ do n't be silly . how could hook have got down here ? ” 

 alas , tinker bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the 
 dark secret of slightly 's tree . nevertheless hook 's words had left no 
 room for doubt . the cup was poisoned . 

 “ besides , ” said peter , quite believing himself , “ i never fell asleep . ” 

 he raised the cup . no time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one 
 of her lightning movements tink got between his lips and the draught , 
 and drained it to the dregs . 

 “ why , tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ” 

 but she did not answer . already she was reeling in the air . 

 “ what is the matter with you ? ” cried peter , suddenly afraid . 

 “ it was poisoned , peter , ” she told him softly ; “ and now i am going to be 
 dead . ” 

 “ o tink , did you drink it to save me ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ but why , tink ? ” 

 her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his 
 shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite . she whispered in his ear “ you 
 silly ass , ” and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed . 

 his head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt 
 near her in distress . every moment her light was growing fainter ; and 
 he knew that if it went out she would be no more . she liked his tears so 
 much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it . 

 her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said . 
 then he made it out . she was saying that she thought she could get well 
 again if children believed in fairies . 

 peter flung out his arms . there were no children there , and it was night 
 time ; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the neverland , and 
 who were therefore nearer to him than you think : boys and girls in their 
 nighties , and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees . 

 “ do you believe ? ” he cried . 

 tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate . 

 she fancied she heard answers in the affirmative , and then again she 
 was n't sure . 

 “ what do you think ? ” she asked peter . 

 “ if you believe , ” he shouted to them , “ clap your hands ; do n't let tink 
 die . ” 

 many clapped . 

 some did n't . 

 a few beasts hissed . 

 the clapping stopped suddenly ; as if countless mothers had rushed to 
 their nurseries to see what on earth was happening ; but already tink was 
 saved . first her voice grew strong , then she popped out of bed , then 
 she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever . she 
 never thought of thanking those who believed , but she would have liked to 
 get at the ones who had hissed . 

 “ and now to rescue wendy ! ” 

 the moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when peter rose from his tree , 
 begirt [ belted ] with weapons and wearing little else , to set out upon 
 his perilous quest . it was not such a night as he would have chosen . 
 he had hoped to fly , keeping not far from the ground so that nothing 
 unwonted should escape his eyes ; but in that fitful light to have 
 flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees , thus 
 disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir . 

 he regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange 
 names that they are very wild and difficult of approach . 

 there was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion , at 
 which happily he was an adept [ expert ] . but in what direction , for he 
 could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship ? a 
 light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks ; and a deathly silence 
 pervaded the island , as if for a space nature stood still in horror of 
 the recent carnage . he had taught the children something of the forest 
 lore that he had himself learned from tiger lily and tinker bell , 
 and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it . 
 slightly , if he had an opportunity , would blaze [ cut a mark in ] the 
 trees , for instance , curly would drop seeds , and wendy would leave her 
 handkerchief at some important place . the morning was needed to search 
 for such guidance , and he could not wait . the upper world had called 
 him , but would give no help . 

 the crocodile passed him , but not another living thing , not a sound , not 
 a movement ; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next 
 tree , or stalking him from behind . 

 he swore this terrible oath : “ hook or me this time . ” 

 now he crawled forward like a snake , and again erect , he darted across 
 a space on which the moonlight played , one finger on his lip and his 
 dagger at the ready . he was frightfully happy . 




 chapter 14 the pirate ship 

 one green light squinting over kidd 's creek , which is near the mouth of 
 the pirate river , marked where the brig , the jolly roger , lay , low in 
 the water ; a rakish - looking [ speedy - looking ] craft foul to the hull , 
 every beam in her detestable , like ground strewn with mangled feathers . 
 she was the cannibal of the seas , and scarce needed that watchful eye , 
 for she floated immune in the horror of her name . 

 she was wrapped in the blanket of night , through which no sound from her 
 could have reached the shore . there was little sound , and none agreeable 
 save the whir of the ship 's sewing machine at which smee sat , ever 
 industrious and obliging , the essence of the commonplace , pathetic smee . 
 i know not why he was so infinitely pathetic , unless it were because 
 he was so pathetically unaware of it ; but even strong men had to turn 
 hastily from looking at him , and more than once on summer evenings he 
 had touched the fount of hook 's tears and made it flow . of this , as of 
 almost everything else , smee was quite unconscious . 

 a few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks , drinking in the miasma 
 [ putrid mist ] of the night ; others sprawled by barrels over games of 
 dice and cards ; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house 
 lay prone on the deck , where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully 
 to this side or that out of hook 's reach , lest he should claw them 
 mechanically in passing . 

 hook trod the deck in thought . o man unfathomable . it was his hour of 
 triumph . peter had been removed for ever from his path , and all the 
 other boys were in the brig , about to walk the plank . it was his 
 grimmest deed since the days when he had brought barbecue to heel ; and 
 knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man , could we be surprised 
 had he now paced the deck unsteadily , bellied out by the winds of his 
 success ? 

 but there was no elation in his gait , which kept pace with the action of 
 his sombre mind . hook was profoundly dejected . 

 he was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the 
 quietude of the night . it was because he was so terribly alone . this 
 inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs . 
 they were socially inferior to him . 

 hook was not his true name . to reveal who he really was would even at 
 this date set the country in a blaze ; but as those who read between the 
 lines must already have guessed , he had been at a famous public school ; 
 and its traditions still clung to him like garments , with which indeed 
 they are largely concerned . thus it was offensive to him even now to 
 board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [ attacked ] her , and 
 he still adhered in his walk to the school 's distinguished slouch . but 
 above all he retained the passion for good form . 

 good form ! however much he may have degenerated , he still knew that this 
 is all that really matters . 

 from far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals , and through 
 them came a stern tap - tap - tap , like hammering in the night when one 
 can not sleep . “ have you been good form to - day ? ” was their eternal 
 question . 

 “ fame , fame , that glittering bauble , it is mine , ” he cried . 

 “ is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything ? ” the tap - tap 
 from his school replied . 

 “ i am the only man whom barbecue feared , ” he urged , “ and flint feared 
 barbecue . ” 

 “ barbecue , flint -- what house ? ” came the cutting retort . 

 most disquieting reflection of all , was it not bad form to think about 
 good form ? 

 his vitals were tortured by this problem . it was a claw within him 
 sharper than the iron one ; and as it tore him , the perspiration dripped 
 down his tallow [ waxy ] countenance and streaked his doublet . ofttimes he 
 drew his sleeve across his face , but there was no damming that trickle . 

 ah , envy not hook . 

 there came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [ death ] . it 
 was as if peter 's terrible oath had boarded the ship . hook felt a gloomy 
 desire to make his dying speech , lest presently there should be no time 
 for it . 

 “ better for hook , ” he cried , “ if he had had less ambition ! ” it was in 
 his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person . 

 “ no little children to love me ! ” 

 strange that he should think of this , which had never troubled him 
 before ; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind . for long he 
 muttered to himself , staring at smee , who was hemming placidly , under 
 the conviction that all children feared him . 

 feared him ! feared smee ! there was not a child on board the brig that 
 night who did not already love him . he had said horrid things to them 
 and hit them with the palm of his hand , because he could not hit with 
 his fist , but they had only clung to him the more . michael had tried on 
 his spectacles . 

 to tell poor smee that they thought him lovable ! hook itched to do it , 
 but it seemed too brutal . instead , he revolved this mystery in his 
 mind : why do they find smee lovable ? he pursued the problem like the 
 sleuth - hound that he was . if smee was lovable , what was it that made him 
 so ? a terrible answer suddenly presented itself--“good form ? ” 

 had the bo'sun good form without knowing it , which is the best form of 
 all ? 

 he remembered that you have to prove you do n't know you have it before 
 you are eligible for pop [ an elite social club at eton ] . 

 with a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over smee 's head ; but he did 
 not tear . what arrested him was this reflection : 

 “ to claw a man because he is good form , what would that be ? ” 

 “ bad form ! ” 

 the unhappy hook was as impotent [ powerless ] as he was damp , and he fell 
 forward like a cut flower . 

 his dogs thinking him out of the way for a time , discipline instantly 
 relaxed ; and they broke into a bacchanalian [ drunken ] dance , which 
 brought him to his feet at once , all traces of human weakness gone , as 
 if a bucket of water had passed over him . 

 “ quiet , you scugs , ” he cried , “ or i 'll cast anchor in you ; ” and at once 
 the din was hushed . “ are all the children chained , so that they can not 
 fly away ? ” 

 “ ay , ay . ” 

 “ then hoist them up . ” 

 the wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except wendy , 
 and ranged in line in front of him . for a time he seemed unconscious 
 of their presence . he lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , 
 snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards . ever and anon 
 the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face . 

 “ now then , bullies , ” he said briskly , “ six of you walk the plank 
 to - night , but i have room for two cabin boys . which of you is it to be ? ” 

 “ do n't irritate him unnecessarily , ” had been wendy 's instructions in 
 the hold ; so tootles stepped forward politely . tootles hated the idea 
 of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would 
 be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a 
 somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be 
 the buffer . all children know this about mothers , and despise them for 
 it , but make constant use of it . 

 so tootles explained prudently , “ you see , sir , i do n't think my mother 
 would like me to be a pirate . would your mother like you to be a pirate , 
 slightly ? ” 

 he winked at slightly , who said mournfully , “ i do n't think so , ” as if 
 he wished things had been otherwise . “ would your mother like you to be a 
 pirate , twin ? ” 

 “ i do n't think so , ” said the first twin , as clever as the others . “ nibs , 
 would-- ” 

 “ stow this gab , ” roared hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back . “ you , 
 boy , ” he said , addressing john , “ you look as if you had a little pluck 
 in you . didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ” 

 now john had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths . prep . ; and 
 he was struck by hook 's picking him out . 

 “ i once thought of calling myself red - handed jack , ” he said diffidently . 

 “ and a good name too . we 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ” 

 “ what do you think , michael ? ” asked john . 

 “ what would you call me if i join ? ” michael demanded . 

 “ blackbeard joe . ” 

 michael was naturally impressed . “ what do you think , john ? ” he wanted 
 john to decide , and john wanted him to decide . 

 “ shall we still be respectful subjects of the king ? ” john inquired . 

 through hook 's teeth came the answer : “ you would have to swear , ' down 
 with the king . ' ” 

 perhaps john had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now . 

 “ then i refuse , ” he cried , banging the barrel in front of hook . 

 “ and i refuse , ” cried michael . 

 “ rule britannia ! ” squeaked curly . 

 the infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and hook roared out , 
 “ that seals your doom . bring up their mother . get the plank ready . ” 

 they were only boys , and they went white as they saw jukes and cecco 
 preparing the fatal plank . but they tried to look brave when wendy was 
 brought up . 

 no words of mine can tell you how wendy despised those pirates . to the 
 boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that 
 she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years . there was not 
 a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with 
 your finger “ dirty pig ” ; and she had already written it on several . but 
 as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for 
 them . 

 “ so , my beauty , ” said hook , as if he spoke in syrup , “ you are to see 
 your children walk the plank . ” 

 fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled 
 his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it . with a hasty 
 gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late . 

 “ are they to die ? ” asked wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt 
 that he nearly fainted . 

 “ they are , ” he snarled . “ silence all , ” he called gloatingly , “ for a 
 mother 's last words to her children . ” 

 at this moment wendy was grand . “ these are my last words , dear boys , ” 
  she said firmly . “ i feel that i have a message to you from your real 
 mothers , and it is this : ' we hope our sons will die like english 
 gentlemen . ' ” 

 even the pirates were awed , and tootles cried out hysterically , “ i am 
 going to do what my mother hopes . what are you to do , nibs ? ” 

 “ what my mother hopes . what are you to do , twin ? ” 

 “ what my mother hopes . john , what are-- ” 

 but hook had found his voice again . 

 “ tie her up ! ” he shouted . 

 it was smee who tied her to the mast . “ see here , honey , ” he whispered , 
 “ i 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ” 

 but not even for smee would she make such a promise . “ i would almost 
 rather have no children at all , ” she said disdainfully [ scornfully ] . 

 it is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as smee tied her to 
 the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they 
 were about to take . they were no longer able to hope that they would 
 walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they 
 could stare and shiver only . 

 hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward wendy . 
 his intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys 
 walking the plank one by one . but he never reached her , he never heard 
 the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her . he heard something else 
 instead . 

 it was the terrible tick - tick of the crocodile . 

 they all heard it -- pirates , boys , wendy ; and immediately every head was 
 blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but 
 toward hook . all knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , 
 and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators . 

 very frightful was it to see the change that came over him . it was as if 
 he had been clipped at every joint . he fell in a little heap . 

 the sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly 
 thought , “ the crocodile is about to board the ship ! ” 

 even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic 
 part of what the attacking force wanted . left so fearfully alone , any 
 other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the 
 gigantic brain of hook was still working , and under its guidance he 
 crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could 
 go . the pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only 
 when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke . 

 “ hide me ! ” he cried hoarsely . 

 they gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming 
 aboard . they had no thought of fighting it . it was fate . 

 only when hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of 
 the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile 
 climbing it . then they got the strangest surprise of the night of 
 nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid . it was 
 peter . 

 he signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might 
 rouse suspicion . then he went on ticking . 




 chapter 15 “ hook or me this time ” 

 odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our 
 noticing for a time that they have happened . thus , to take an instance , 
 we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we do n't know 
 how long , but , say , half an hour . now such an experience had come that 
 night to peter . when last we saw him he was stealing across the island 
 with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready . he had seen the 
 crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it , but by 
 and by he remembered that it had not been ticking . at first he thought 
 this eerie , but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down . 

 without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a 
 fellow - creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion , peter 
 began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use ; 
 and he decided to tick , so that wild beasts should believe he was the 
 crocodile and let him pass unmolested . he ticked superbly , but with one 
 unforeseen result . the crocodile was among those who heard the sound , 
 and it followed him , though whether with the purpose of regaining what 
 it had lost , or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again 
 ticking itself , will never be certainly known , for , like slaves to a 
 fixed idea , it was a stupid beast . 

 peter reached the shore without mishap , and went straight on , his legs 
 encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new 
 element . thus many animals pass from land to water , but no other human 
 of whom i know . as he swam he had but one thought : “ hook or me this 
 time . ” he had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing 
 that he was doing it . had he known he would have stopped , for to board 
 the brig by help of the tick , though an ingenious idea , had not occurred 
 to him . 

 on the contrary , he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a 
 mouse ; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him , with hook 
 in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile . 

 the crocodile ! no sooner did peter remember it than he heard the 
 ticking . at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile , 
 and he looked behind him swiftly . then he realised that he was doing it 
 himself , and in a flash he understood the situation . “ how clever of me ! ” 
  he thought at once , and signed to the boys not to burst into applause . 

 it was at this moment that ed teynte the quartermaster emerged from the 
 forecastle and came along the deck . now , reader , time what happened by 
 your watch . peter struck true and deep . john clapped his hands on the 
 ill - fated pirate 's mouth to stifle the dying groan . he fell forward . 
 four boys caught him to prevent the thud . peter gave the signal , and the 
 carrion was cast overboard . there was a splash , and then silence . how 
 long has it taken ? 

 “ one ! ” ( slightly had begun to count . ) 

 none too soon , peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the 
 cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look 
 round . they could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which 
 showed them that the more terrible sound had passed . 

 “ it 's gone , captain , ” smee said , wiping off his spectacles . “ all 's still 
 again . ” 

 slowly hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently 
 that he could have caught the echo of the tick . there was not a sound , 
 and he drew himself up firmly to his full height . 

 “ then here 's to johnny plank ! ” he cried brazenly , hating the boys more 
 than ever because they had seen him unbend . he broke into the villainous 
 ditty : 

      “ yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , 
      you walks along it so , 
      till it goes down and you goes down 
      to davy jones below ! ” 

 to terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of 
 dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he 
 sang ; and when he finished he cried , “ do you want a touch of the cat [ o ' 
 nine tails ] before you walk the plank ? ” 

 at that they fell on their knees . “ no , no ! ” they cried so piteously that 
 every pirate smiled . 

 “ fetch the cat , jukes , ” said hook ; “ it 's in the cabin . ” 

 the cabin ! peter was in the cabin ! the children gazed at each other . 

 “ ay , ay , ” said jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin . they 
 followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that hook had resumed his 
 song , his dogs joining in with him : 

      “ yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , 
      its tails are nine , you know , 
      and when they 're writ upon your back-- ” 

 what was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was 
 stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin . it wailed through the ship , 
 and died away . then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood 
 by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech . 

 “ what was that ? ” cried hook . 

 “ two , ” said slightly solemnly . 

 the italian cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin . 
 he tottered out , haggard . 

 “ what 's the matter with bill jukes , you dog ? ” hissed hook , towering over 
 him . 

 “ the matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , ” replied cecco in a hollow 
 voice . 

 “ bill jukes dead ! ” cried the startled pirates . 

 “ the cabin 's as black as a pit , ” cecco said , almost gibbering , “ but 
 there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ” 

 the exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were 
 seen by hook . 

 “ cecco , ” he said in his most steely voice , “ go back and fetch me out 
 that doodle - doo . ” 

 cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying “ no , 
 no ” ; but hook was purring to his claw . 

 “ did you say you would go , cecco ? ” he said musingly . 

 cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly . there was no more 
 singing , all listened now ; and again came a death - screech and again a 
 crow . 

 no one spoke except slightly . “ three , ” he said . 

 hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . “ ' s'death and odds fish , ” he 
 thundered , “ who is to bring me that doodle - doo ? ” 

 “ wait till cecco comes out , ” growled starkey , and the others took up the 
 cry . 

 “ i think i heard you volunteer , starkey , ” said hook , purring again . 

 “ no , by thunder ! ” starkey cried . 

 “ my hook thinks you did , ” said hook , crossing to him . “ i wonder if it 
 would not be advisable , starkey , to humour the hook ? ” 

 “ i 'll swing before i go in there , ” replied starkey doggedly , and again 
 he had the support of the crew . 

 “ is this mutiny ? ” asked hook more pleasantly than ever . “ starkey 's 
 ringleader ! ” 

 “ captain , mercy ! ” starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now . 

 “ shake hands , starkey , ” said hook , proffering his claw . 

 starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him . as he backed up 
 hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye . with a despairing 
 scream the pirate leapt upon long tom and precipitated himself into the 
 sea . 

 “ four , ” said slightly . 

 “ and now , ” hook said courteously , “ did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ” 
  seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , “ i 'll 
 bring out that doodle - doo myself , ” he said , and sped into the cabin . 

 “ five . ” how slightly longed to say it . he wetted his lips to be ready , 
 but hook came staggering out , without his lantern . 

 “ something blew out the light , ” he said a little unsteadily . 

 “ something ! ” echoed mullins . 

 “ what of cecco ? ” demanded noodler . 

 “ he 's as dead as jukes , ” said hook shortly . 

 his reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , 
 and the mutinous sounds again broke forth . all pirates are 
 superstitious , and cookson cried , “ they do say the surest sign a ship 's 
 accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ” 

 “ i 've heard , ” muttered mullins , “ he always boards the pirate craft last . 
 had he a tail , captain ? ” 

 “ they say , ” said another , looking viciously at hook , “ that when he comes 
 it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ” 

 “ had he a hook , captain ? ” asked cookson insolently ; and one after 
 another took up the cry , “ the ship 's doomed ! ” at this the children could 
 not resist raising a cheer . hook had well - nigh forgotten his prisoners , 
 but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again . 

 “ lads , ” he cried to his crew , “ now here 's a notion . open the cabin door 
 and drive them in . let them fight the doodle - doo for their lives . if 
 they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none 
 the worse . ” 

 for the last time his dogs admired hook , and devotedly they did his 
 bidding . the boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin 
 and the door was closed on them . 

 “ now , listen ! ” cried hook , and all listened . but not one dared to face 
 the door . yes , one , wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast . 
 it was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for 
 the reappearance of peter . 

 she had not long to wait . in the cabin he had found the thing for which 
 he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their 
 manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they 
 could find . first signing them to hide , peter cut wendy 's bonds , 
 and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off 
 together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , “ hook or me this time . ” 
  so when he had freed wendy , he whispered for her to conceal herself with 
 the others , and himself took her place by the mast , her cloak around him 
 so that he should pass for her . then he took a great breath and crowed . 

 to the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the 
 cabin ; and they were panic - stricken . hook tried to hearten them ; but 
 like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs , and he knew 
 that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him . 

 “ lads , ” he said , ready to cajole or strike as need be , but never 
 quailing for an instant , “ i 've thought it out . there 's a jonah aboard . ” 

 “ ay , ” they snarled , “ a man wi ' a hook . ” 

 “ no , lads , no , it 's the girl . never was luck on a pirate ship wi ' a 
 woman on board . we 'll right the ship when she 's gone . ” 

 some of them remembered that this had been a saying of flint 's . “ it 's 
 worth trying , ” they said doubtfully . 

 “ fling the girl overboard , ” cried hook ; and they made a rush at the 
 figure in the cloak . 

 “ there 's none can save you now , missy , ” mullins hissed jeeringly . 

 “ there 's one , ” replied the figure . 

 “ who 's that ? ” 

 “ peter pan the avenger ! ” came the terrible answer ; and as he spoke peter 
 flung off his cloak . then they all knew who ' twas that had been undoing 
 them in the cabin , and twice hook essayed to speak and twice he failed . 
 in that frightful moment i think his fierce heart broke . 

 at last he cried , “ cleave him to the brisket ! ” but without conviction . 

 “ down , boys , and at them ! ” peter 's voice rang out ; and in another moment 
 the clash of arms was resounding through the ship . had the pirates kept 
 together it is certain that they would have won ; but the onset came 
 when they were still unstrung , and they ran hither and thither , striking 
 wildly , each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew . man to man 
 they were the stronger ; but they fought on the defensive only , which 
 enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry . some of the 
 miscreants leapt into the sea ; others hid in dark recesses , where they 
 were found by slightly , who did not fight , but ran about with a lantern 
 which he flashed in their faces , so that they were half blinded and 
 fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys . there was 
 little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons , an occasional 
 screech or splash , and slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven 
 eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven . 

 i think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded hook , who 
 seemed to have a charmed life , as he kept them at bay in that circle 
 of fire . they had done for his dogs , but this man alone seemed to be a 
 match for them all . again and again they closed upon him , and again and 
 again he hewed a clear space . he had lifted up one boy with his hook , 
 and was using him as a buckler [ shield ] , when another , who had just 
 passed his sword through mullins , sprang into the fray . 

 “ put up your swords , boys , ” cried the newcomer , “ this man is mine . ” 

 thus suddenly hook found himself face to face with peter . the others 
 drew back and formed a ring around them . 

 for long the two enemies looked at one another , hook shuddering 
 slightly , and peter with the strange smile upon his face . 

 “ so , pan , ” said hook at last , “ this is all your doing . ” 

 “ ay , james hook , ” came the stern answer , “ it is all my doing . ” 

 “ proud and insolent youth , ” said hook , “ prepare to meet thy doom . ” 

 “ dark and sinister man , ” peter answered , “ have at thee . ” 

 without more words they fell to , and for a space there was no advantage 
 to either blade . peter was a superb swordsman , and parried with dazzling 
 rapidity ; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got 
 past his foe 's defence , but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead , 
 and he could not drive the steel home . hook , scarcely his inferior in 
 brilliancy , but not quite so nimble in wrist play , forced him back by 
 the weight of his onset , hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite 
 thrust , taught him long ago by barbecue at rio ; but to his astonishment 
 he found this thrust turned aside again and again . then he sought to 
 close and give the quietus with his iron hook , which all this time had 
 been pawing the air ; but peter doubled under it and , lunging fiercely , 
 pierced him in the ribs . at the sight of his own blood , whose peculiar 
 colour , you remember , was offensive to him , the sword fell from hook 's 
 hand , and he was at peter 's mercy . 

 “ now ! ” cried all the boys , but with a magnificent gesture peter invited 
 his opponent to pick up his sword . hook did so instantly , but with a 
 tragic feeling that peter was showing good form . 

 hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him , but darker 
 suspicions assailed him now . 

 “ pan , who and what art thou ? ” he cried huskily . 

 “ i 'm youth , i 'm joy , ” peter answered at a venture , “ i 'm a little bird 
 that has broken out of the egg . ” 

 this , of course , was nonsense ; but it was proof to the unhappy hook that 
 peter did not know in the least who or what he was , which is the very 
 pinnacle of good form . 

 “ to't again , ” he cried despairingly . 

 he fought now like a human flail , and every sweep of that terrible sword 
 would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it ; but peter 
 fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the 
 danger zone . and again and again he darted in and pricked . 

 hook was fighting now without hope . that passionate breast no longer 
 asked for life ; but for one boon it craved : to see peter show bad form 
 before it was cold forever . 

 abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it . 

 “ in two minutes , ” he cried , “ the ship will be blown to pieces . ” 

 now , now , he thought , true form will show . 

 but peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands , 
 and calmly flung it overboard . 

 what sort of form was hook himself showing ? misguided man though he was , 
 we may be glad , without sympathising with him , that in the end he was 
 true to the traditions of his race . the other boys were flying around 
 him now , flouting , scornful ; and he staggered about the deck striking up 
 at them impotently , his mind was no longer with them ; it was slouching 
 in the playing fields of long ago , or being sent up [ to the headmaster ] 
 for good , or watching the wall - game from a famous wall . and his shoes 
 were right , and his waistcoat was right , and his tie was right , and his 
 socks were right . 

 james hook , thou not wholly unheroic figure , farewell . 

 for we have come to his last moment . 

 seeing peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger 
 poised , he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea . he 
 did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him ; for we purposely 
 stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him : a little mark 
 of respect from us at the end . 

 he had one last triumph , which i think we need not grudge him . as he 
 stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at peter gliding through 
 the air , he invited him with a gesture to use his foot . it made peter 
 kick instead of stab . 

 at last hook had got the boon for which he craved . 

 “ bad form , ” he cried jeeringly , and went content to the crocodile . 

 thus perished james hook . 

 “ seventeen , ” slightly sang out ; but he was not quite correct in his 
 figures . fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night ; but two 
 reached the shore : starkey to be captured by the redskins , who made him 
 nurse for all their papooses , a melancholy come - down for a pirate ; and 
 smee , who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles , making 
 a precarious living by saying he was the only man that jas . hook had 
 feared . 

 wendy , of course , had stood by taking no part in the fight , though 
 watching peter with glistening eyes ; but now that all was over she 
 became prominent again . she praised them equally , and shuddered 
 delightfully when michael showed her the place where he had killed one ; 
 and then she took them into hook 's cabin and pointed to his watch which 
 was hanging on a nail . it said “ half - past one ! ” 

 the lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all . she got 
 them to bed in the pirates ' bunks pretty quickly , you may be sure ; all 
 but peter , who strutted up and down on the deck , until at last he fell 
 asleep by the side of long tom . he had one of his dreams that night , and 
 cried in his sleep for a long time , and wendy held him tightly . 




 chapter 16 the return home 

 by three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps [ legs ] ; 
 for there was a big sea running ; and tootles , the bo'sun , was among 
 them , with a rope 's end in his hand and chewing tobacco . they all donned 
 pirate clothes cut off at the knee , shaved smartly , and tumbled up , with 
 the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers . 

 it need not be said who was the captain . nibs and john were first and 
 second mate . there was a woman aboard . the rest were tars [ sailors ] 
 before the mast , and lived in the fo'c'sle . peter had already lashed 
 himself to the wheel ; but he piped all hands and delivered a short 
 address to them ; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant 
 hearties , but that he knew they were the scum of rio and the gold coast , 
 and if they snapped at him he would tear them . the bluff strident words 
 struck the note sailors understood , and they cheered him lustily . then 
 a few sharp orders were given , and they turned the ship round , and nosed 
 her for the mainland . 

 captain pan calculated , after consulting the ship 's chart , that if this 
 weather lasted they should strike the azores about the 21st of june , 
 after which it would save time to fly . 

 some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour 
 of keeping it a pirate ; but the captain treated them as dogs , and they 
 dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin [ one person 
 after another , as they had to cpt . hook ] . instant obedience was the only 
 safe thing . slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take 
 soundings . the general feeling was that peter was honest just now to 
 lull wendy 's suspicions , but that there might be a change when the new 
 suit was ready , which , against her will , she was making for him out of 
 some of hook 's wickedest garments . it was afterwards whispered among 
 them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin 
 with hook 's cigar - holder in his mouth and one hand clenched , all but for 
 the forefinger , which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook . 

 instead of watching the ship , however , we must now return to that 
 desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless 
 flight so long ago . it seems a shame to have neglected no . 14 all this 
 time ; and yet we may be sure that mrs. darling does not blame us . if we 
 had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her , she would 
 probably have cried , “ do n't be silly ; what do i matter ? do go back and 
 keep an eye on the children . ” so long as mothers are like this their 
 children will take advantage of them ; and they may lay to [ bet on ] that . 

 even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful 
 occupants are on their way home ; we are merely hurrying on in advance 
 of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that mr. and mrs. 
 darling do not go out for the evening . we are no more than servants . why 
 on earth should their beds be properly aired , seeing that they left them 
 in such a thankless hurry ? would it not serve them jolly well right if 
 they came back and found that their parents were spending the week - end 
 in the country ? it would be the moral lesson they have been in need 
 of ever since we met them ; but if we contrived things in this way mrs. 
 darling would never forgive us . 

 one thing i should like to do immensely , and that is to tell her , in the 
 way authors have , that the children are coming back , that indeed they 
 will be here on thursday week . this would spoil so completely the 
 surprise to which wendy and john and michael are looking forward . they 
 have been planning it out on the ship : mother 's rapture , father 's shout 
 of joy , nana 's leap through the air to embrace them first , when what 
 they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding . how delicious to spoil 
 it all by breaking the news in advance ; so that when they enter grandly 
 mrs. darling may not even offer wendy her mouth , and mr. darling may 
 exclaim pettishly , “ dash it all , here are those boys again . ” however , 
 we should get no thanks even for this . we are beginning to know mrs. 
 darling by this time , and may be sure that she would upbraid us for 
 depriving the children of their little pleasure . 

 “ but , my dear madam , it is ten days till thursday week ; so that by 
 telling you what 's what , we can save you ten days of unhappiness . ” 

 “ yes , but at what a cost ! by depriving the children of ten minutes of 
 delight . ” 

 “ oh , if you look at it in that way ! ” 

 “ what other way is there in which to look at it ? ” 

 you see , the woman had no proper spirit . i had meant to say 
 extraordinarily nice things about her ; but i despise her , and not one of 
 them will i say now . she does not really need to be told to have things 
 ready , for they are ready . all the beds are aired , and she never leaves 
 the house , and observe , the window is open . for all the use we are to 
 her , we might well go back to the ship . however , as we are here we may 
 as well stay and look on . that is all we are , lookers - on . nobody really 
 wants us . so let us watch and say jaggy things , in the hope that some of 
 them will hurt . 

 the only change to be seen in the night - nursery is that between nine 
 and six the kennel is no longer there . when the children flew away , mr. 
 darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained 
 nana up , and that from first to last she had been wiser than he . of 
 course , as we have seen , he was quite a simple man ; indeed he might have 
 passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off ; 
 but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion 's courage to do what 
 seemed right to him ; and having thought the matter out with anxious care 
 after the flight of the children , he went down on all fours and crawled 
 into the kennel . to all mrs. darling 's dear invitations to him to come 
 out he replied sadly but firmly : 

 “ no , my own one , this is the place for me . ” 

 in the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave 
 the kennel until his children came back . of course this was a pity ; but 
 whatever mr. darling did he had to do in excess , otherwise he soon gave 
 up doing it . and there never was a more humble man than the once proud 
 george darling , as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his 
 wife of their children and all their pretty ways . 

 very touching was his deference to nana . he would not let her come into 
 the kennel , but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly . 

 every morning the kennel was carried with mr. darling in it to a cab , 
 which conveyed him to his office , and he returned home in the same way 
 at six . something of the strength of character of the man will be seen 
 if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours : this 
 man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention . inwardly he 
 must have suffered torture ; but he preserved a calm exterior even when 
 the young criticised his little home , and he always lifted his hat 
 courteously to any lady who looked inside . 

 it may have been quixotic , but it was magnificent . soon the inward 
 meaning of it leaked out , and the great heart of the public was touched . 
 crowds followed the cab , cheering it lustily ; charming girls scaled it 
 to get his autograph ; interviews appeared in the better class of papers , 
 and society invited him to dinner and added , “ do come in the kennel . ” 

 on that eventful thursday week , mrs. darling was in the night - nursery 
 awaiting george 's return home ; a very sad - eyed woman . now that we look 
 at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days , all gone 
 now just because she has lost her babes , i find i wo n't be able to say 
 nasty things about her after all . if she was too fond of her rubbishy 
 children , she could n't help it . look at her in her chair , where she has 
 fallen asleep . the corner of her mouth , where one looks first , is almost 
 withered up . her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a 
 pain there . some like peter best , and some like wendy best , but i like 
 her best . suppose , to make her happy , we whisper to her in her sleep 
 that the brats are coming back . they are really within two miles of the 
 window now , and flying strong , but all we need whisper is that they are 
 on the way . let 's . 

 it is a pity we did it , for she has started up , calling their names ; and 
 there is no one in the room but nana . 

 “ o nana , i dreamt my dear ones had come back . ” 

 nana had filmy eyes , but all she could do was put her paw gently on her 
 mistress 's lap ; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was 
 brought back . as mr. darling puts his head out to kiss his wife , we see 
 that his face is more worn than of yore , but has a softer expression . 

 he gave his hat to liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no 
 imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of 
 such a man . outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were 
 still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved . 

 “ listen to them , ” he said ; “ it is very gratifying . ” 

 “ lots of little boys , ” sneered liza . 

 “ there were several adults to - day , ” he assured her with a faint flush ; 
 but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her . 
 social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter . for some 
 time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with mrs. darling 
 of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she 
 hoped his head would not be turned by it . 

 “ but if i had been a weak man , ” he said . “ good heavens , if i had been a 
 weak man ! ” 

 “ and , george , ” she said timidly , “ you are as full of remorse as ever , 
 are n't you ? ” 

 “ full of remorse as ever , dearest ! see my punishment : living in a 
 kennel . ” 

 “ but it is punishment , is n't it , george ? you are sure you are not 
 enjoying it ? ” 

 “ my love ! ” 

 you may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he 
 curled round in the kennel . 

 “ wo n't you play me to sleep , ” he asked , “ on the nursery piano ? ” and as 
 she was crossing to the day - nursery he added thoughtlessly , “ and shut 
 that window . i feel a draught . ” 

 “ o george , never ask me to do that . the window must always be left open 
 for them , always , always . ” 

 now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day - nursery 
 and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , wendy and john 
 and michael flew into the room . 

 oh no . we have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement 
 planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have 
 happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is peter 
 and tinker bell . 

 peter 's first words tell all . 

 “ quick tink , ” he whispered , “ close the window ; bar it ! that 's right . now 
 you and i must get away by the door ; and when wendy comes she will think 
 her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ” 

 now i understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when peter had 
 exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave tink 
 to escort the children to the mainland . this trick had been in his head 
 all the time . 

 instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then 
 he peeped into the day - nursery to see who was playing . he whispered to 
 tink , “ it 's wendy 's mother ! she is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as 
 my mother . her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's 
 was . ” 

 of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes 
 bragged about her . 

 he did not know the tune , which was “ home , sweet home , ” but he knew it 
 was saying , “ come back , wendy , wendy , wendy ” ; and he cried exultantly , 
 “ you will never see wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ” 

 he peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw 
 that mrs. darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were 
 sitting on her eyes . 

 “ she wants me to unbar the window , ” thought peter , “ but i wo n't , not i ! ” 

 he peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had 
 taken their place . 

 “ she 's awfully fond of wendy , ” he said to himself . he was angry with her 
 now for not seeing why she could not have wendy . 

 the reason was so simple : “ i 'm fond of her too . we ca n't both have her , 
 lady . ” 

 but the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy . he 
 ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him . he 
 skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as 
 if she were inside him , knocking . 

 “ oh , all right , ” he said at last , and gulped . then he unbarred the 
 window . “ come on , tink , ” he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of 
 nature ; “ we do n't want any silly mothers ; ” and he flew away . 

 thus wendy and john and michael found the window open for them after 
 all , which of course was more than they deserved . they alighted on the 
 floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already 
 forgotten his home . 

 “ john , ” he said , looking around him doubtfully , “ i think i have been 
 here before . ” 

 “ of course you have , you silly . there is your old bed . ” 

 “ so it is , ” michael said , but not with much conviction . 

 “ i say , ” cried john , “ the kennel ! ” and he dashed across to look into it . 

 “ perhaps nana is inside it , ” wendy said . 

 but john whistled . “ hullo , ” he said , “ there 's a man inside it . ” 

 “ it 's father ! ” exclaimed wendy . 

 “ let me see father , ” michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look . 
 “ he is not so big as the pirate i killed , ” he said with such frank 
 disappointment that i am glad mr. darling was asleep ; it would have been 
 sad if those had been the first words he heard his little michael say . 

 wendy and john had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in 
 the kennel . 

 “ surely , ” said john , like one who had lost faith in his memory , “ he used 
 not to sleep in the kennel ? ” 

 “ john , ” wendy said falteringly , “ perhaps we do n't remember the old life 
 as well as we thought we did . ” 

 a chill fell upon them ; and serve them right . 

 “ it is very careless of mother , ” said that young scoundrel john , “ not to 
 be here when we come back . ” 

 it was then that mrs. darling began playing again . 

 “ it 's mother ! ” cried wendy , peeping . 

 “ so it is ! ” said john . 

 “ then are you not really our mother , wendy ? ” asked michael , who was 
 surely sleepy . 

 “ oh dear ! ” exclaimed wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse [ for 
 having gone ] , “ it was quite time we came back . ” 

 “ let us creep in , ” john suggested , “ and put our hands over her eyes . ” 

 but wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had 
 a better plan . 

 “ let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as 
 if we had never been away . ” 

 and so when mrs. darling went back to the night - nursery to see if her 
 husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied . the children waited 
 for her cry of joy , but it did not come . she saw them , but she did not 
 believe they were there . you see , she saw them in their beds so often in 
 her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her 
 still . 

 she sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had 
 nursed them . 

 they could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three 
 of them . 

 “ mother ! ” wendy cried . 

 “ that 's wendy , ” she said , but still she was sure it was the dream . 

 “ mother ! ” 

 “ that 's john , ” she said . 

 “ mother ! ” cried michael . he knew her now . 

 “ that 's michael , ” she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three 
 little selfish children they would never envelop again . yes , they did , 
 they went round wendy and john and michael , who had slipped out of bed 
 and run to her . 

 “ george , george ! ” she cried when she could speak ; and mr. darling woke 
 to share her bliss , and nana came rushing in . there could not have been 
 a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who 
 was staring in at the window . he had had ecstasies innumerable that 
 other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at 
 the one joy from which he must be for ever barred . 




 chapter 17 when wendy grew up 

 i hope you want to know what became of the other boys . they were waiting 
 below to give wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had 
 counted five hundred they went up . they went up by the stair , because 
 they thought this would make a better impression . they stood in a row 
 in front of mrs. darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not 
 wearing their pirate clothes . they said nothing , but their eyes asked 
 her to have them . they ought to have looked at mr. darling also , but 
 they forgot about him . 

 of course mrs. darling said at once that she would have them ; but mr. 
 darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a 
 rather large number . 

 “ i must say , ” he said to wendy , “ that you do n't do things by halves , ” a 
 grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them . 

 the first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , “ do you think 
 we should be too much of a handful , sir ? because , if so , we can go 
 away . ” 

 “ father ! ” wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him . he knew 
 he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it . 

 “ we could lie doubled up , ” said nibs . 

 “ i always cut their hair myself , ” said wendy . 

 “ george ! ” mrs. darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing 
 himself in such an unfavourable light . 

 then he burst into tears , and the truth came out . he was as glad to 
 have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his 
 consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher [ zero ] in 
 his own house . 

 “ i do n't think he is a cypher , ” tootles cried instantly . “ do you think 
 he is a cypher , curly ? ” 

 “ no , i do n't . do you think he is a cypher , slightly ? ” 

 “ rather not . twin , what do you think ? ” 

 it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was 
 absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the 
 drawing - room if they fitted in . 

 “ we 'll fit in , sir , ” they assured him . 

 “ then follow the leader , ” he cried gaily . “ mind you , i am not sure that 
 we have a drawing - room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same . 
 hoop la ! ” 

 he went off dancing through the house , and they all cried “ hoop la ! ” and 
 danced after him , searching for the drawing - room ; and i forget whether 
 they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted 
 in . 

 as for peter , he saw wendy once again before he flew away . he did not 
 exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that 
 she could open it if she liked and call to him . that is what she did . 

 “ hullo , wendy , good - bye , ” he said . 

 “ oh dear , are you going away ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ you do n't feel , peter , ” she said falteringly , “ that you would like to 
 say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ about me , peter ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 mrs. darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp 
 eye on wendy . she told peter that she had adopted all the other boys , 
 and would like to adopt him also . 

 “ would you send me to school ? ” he inquired craftily . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ and then to an office ? ” 

 “ i suppose so . ” 

 “ soon i would be a man ? ” 

 “ very soon . ” 

 “ i do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , ” he told her 
 passionately . “ i do n't want to be a man . o wendy 's mother , if i was to 
 wake up and feel there was a beard ! ” 

 “ peter , ” said wendy the comforter , “ i should love you in a beard ; ” and 
 mrs. darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her . 

 “ keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ” 

 “ but where are you going to live ? ” 

 “ with tink in the house we built for wendy . the fairies are to put it 
 high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ” 

 “ how lovely , ” cried wendy so longingly that mrs. darling tightened her 
 grip . 

 “ i thought all the fairies were dead , ” mrs. darling said . 

 “ there are always a lot of young ones , ” explained wendy , who was now 
 quite an authority , “ because you see when a new baby laughs for the 
 first time a new fairy is born , and as there are always new babies there 
 are always new fairies . they live in nests on the tops of trees ; and the 
 mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls , and the blue ones are 
 just little sillies who are not sure what they are . ” 

 “ i shall have such fun , ” said peter , with eye on wendy . 

 “ it will be rather lonely in the evening , ” she said , “ sitting by the 
 fire . ” 

 “ i shall have tink . ” 

 “ tink ca n't go a twentieth part of the way round , ” she reminded him a 
 little tartly . 

 “ sneaky tell - tale ! ” tink called out from somewhere round the corner . 

 “ it does n't matter , ” peter said . 

 “ o peter , you know it matters . ” 

 “ well , then , come with me to the little house . ” 

 “ may i , mummy ? ” 

 “ certainly not . i have got you home again , and i mean to keep you . ” 

 “ but he does so need a mother . ” 

 “ so do you , my love . ” 

 “ oh , all right , ” peter said , as if he had asked her from politeness 
 merely ; but mrs. darling saw his mouth twitch , and she made this 
 handsome offer : to let wendy go to him for a week every year to do 
 his spring cleaning . wendy would have preferred a more permanent 
 arrangement ; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming ; 
 but this promise sent peter away quite gay again . he had no sense of 
 time , and was so full of adventures that all i have told you about him 
 is only a halfpenny - worth of them . i suppose it was because wendy knew 
 this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones : 

 “ you wo n't forget me , peter , will you , before spring cleaning time 
 comes ? ” 

 of course peter promised ; and then he flew away . he took mrs. darling 's 
 kiss with him . the kiss that had been for no one else , peter took quite 
 easily . funny . but she seemed satisfied . 

 of course all the boys went to school ; and most of them got into class 
 iii , but slightly was put first into class iv and then into class v. 
 class i is the top class . before they had attended school a week they 
 saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island ; but it was too 
 late now , and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me 
 or jenkins minor [ the younger jenkins ] . it is sad to have to say that 
 the power to fly gradually left them . at first nana tied their feet to 
 the bed - posts so that they should not fly away in the night ; and one of 
 their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [ the english 
 double - deckers ] ; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed , 
 and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus . in time 
 they could not even fly after their hats . want of practice , they called 
 it ; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed . 

 michael believed longer than the other boys , though they jeered at him ; 
 so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first 
 year . she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leaves 
 and berries in the neverland , and her one fear was that he might notice 
 how short it had become ; but he never noticed , he had so much to say 
 about himself . 

 she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times , but 
 new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind . 

 “ who is captain hook ? ” he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch 
 enemy . 

 “ do n't you remember , ” she asked , amazed , “ how you killed him and saved 
 all our lives ? ” 

 “ i forget them after i kill them , ” he replied carelessly . 

 when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see 
 her he said , “ who is tinker bell ? ” 

 “ o peter , ” she said , shocked ; but even when she explained he could not 
 remember . 

 “ there are such a lot of them , ” he said . “ i expect she is no more . ” 

 i expect he was right , for fairies do n't live long , but they are so 
 little that a short time seems a good while to them . 

 wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday 
 to peter ; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her . but he was 
 exactly as fascinating as ever , and they had a lovely spring cleaning in 
 the little house on the tree tops . 

 next year he did not come for her . she waited in a new frock because the 
 old one simply would not meet ; but he never came . 

 “ perhaps he is ill , ” michael said . 

 “ you know he is never ill . ” 

 michael came close to her and whispered , with a shiver , “ perhaps there 
 is no such person , wendy ! ” and then wendy would have cried if michael 
 had not been crying . 

 peter came next spring cleaning ; and the strange thing was that he never 
 knew he had missed a year . 

 that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him . for a little longer 
 she tried for his sake not to have growing pains ; and she felt she was 
 untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge . but the years 
 came and went without bringing the careless boy ; and when they met again 
 wendy was a married woman , and peter was no more to her than a little 
 dust in the box in which she had kept her toys . wendy was grown up . you 
 need not be sorry for her . she was one of the kind that likes to grow 
 up . in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other 
 girls . 

 all the boys were grown up and done for by this time ; so it is scarcely 
 worth while saying anything more about them . you may see the twins and 
 nibs and curly any day going to an office , each carrying a little bag 
 and an umbrella . michael is an engine - driver [ train engineer ] . slightly 
 married a lady of title , and so he became a lord . you see that judge in 
 a wig coming out at the iron door ? that used to be tootles . the bearded 
 man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once john . 

 wendy was married in white with a pink sash . it is strange to think 
 that peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [ formal 
 announcement of a marriage ] . 

 years rolled on again , and wendy had a daughter . this ought not to be 
 written in ink but in a golden splash . 

 she was called jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from 
 the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions . when 
 she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan . she 
 loved to hear of peter , and wendy told her all she could remember in the 
 very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place . it was 
 jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents 
 [ mortgage rate ] from wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs . 
 mrs. darling was now dead and forgotten . 

 there were only two beds in the nursery now , jane 's and her nurse 's ; and 
 there was no kennel , for nana also had passed away . she died of old age , 
 and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very 
 firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except 
 herself . 

 once a week jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was wendy 's 
 part to put jane to bed . that was the time for stories . it was jane 's 
 invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus 
 making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : 

 “ what do we see now ? ” 

 “ i do n't think i see anything to - night , ” says wendy , with a feeling that 
 if nana were here she would object to further conversation . 

 “ yes , you do , ” says jane , “ you see when you were a little girl . ” 

 “ that is a long time ago , sweetheart , ” says wendy . “ ah me , how time 
 flies ! ” 

 “ does it fly , ” asks the artful child , “ the way you flew when you were a 
 little girl ? ” 

 “ the way i flew ? do you know , jane , i sometimes wonder whether i ever 
 did really fly . ” 

 “ yes , you did . ” 

 “ the dear old days when i could fly ! ” 

 “ why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ” 

 “ because i am grown up , dearest . when people grow up they forget the 
 way . ” 

 “ why do they forget the way ? ” 

 “ because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless . it is only 
 the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ” 

 “ what is gay and innocent and heartless ? i do wish i were gay and 
 innocent and heartless . ” 

 or perhaps wendy admits she does see something . 

 “ i do believe , ” she says , “ that it is this nursery . ” 

 “ i do believe it is , ” says jane . “ go on . ” 

 they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter 
 flew in looking for his shadow . 

 “ the foolish fellow , ” says wendy , “ tried to stick it on with soap , and 
 when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and i sewed it on for 
 him . ” 

 “ you have missed a bit , ” interrupts jane , who now knows the story better 
 than her mother . “ when you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did 
 you say ? ” 

 “ i sat up in bed and i said , ' boy , why are you crying ? ' ” 

 “ yes , that was it , ” says jane , with a big breath . 

 “ and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the 
 pirates and the redskins and the mermaids ' lagoon , and the home under 
 the ground , and the little house . ” 

 “ yes ! which did you like best of all ? ” 

 “ i think i liked the home under the ground best of all . ” 

 “ yes , so do i. what was the last thing peter ever said to you ? ” 

 “ the last thing he ever said to me was , ' just always be waiting for me , 
 and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ but , alas , he forgot all about me , ” wendy said it with a smile . she was 
 as grown up as that . 

 “ what did his crow sound like ? ” jane asked one evening . 

 “ it was like this , ” wendy said , trying to imitate peter 's crow . 

 “ no , it was n't , ” jane said gravely , “ it was like this ; ” and she did it 
 ever so much better than her mother . 

 wendy was a little startled . “ my darling , how can you know ? ” 

 “ i often hear it when i am sleeping , ” jane said . 

 “ ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but i was the only 
 one who heard it awake . ” 

 “ lucky you , ” said jane . 

 and then one night came the tragedy . it was the spring of the year , and 
 the story had been told for the night , and jane was now asleep in her 
 bed . wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to 
 see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she 
 sat darning she heard a crow . then the window blew open as of old , and 
 peter dropped in on the floor . 

 he was exactly the same as ever , and wendy saw at once that he still had 
 all his first teeth . 

 he was a little boy , and she was grown up . she huddled by the fire not 
 daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman . 

 “ hullo , wendy , ” he said , not noticing any difference , for he was 
 thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might 
 have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first . 

 “ hullo , peter , ” she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as 
 possible . something inside her was crying “ woman , woman , let go of me . ” 

 “ hullo , where is john ? ” he asked , suddenly missing the third bed . 

 “ john is not here now , ” she gasped . 

 “ is michael asleep ? ” he asked , with a careless glance at jane . 

 “ yes , ” she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to jane as 
 well as to peter . 

 “ that is not michael , ” she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on 
 her . 

 peter looked . “ hullo , is it a new one ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ boy or girl ? ” 

 “ girl . ” 

 now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it . 

 “ peter , ” she said , faltering , “ are you expecting me to fly away with 
 you ? ” 

 “ of course ; that is why i have come . ” he added a little sternly , “ have 
 you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ” 

 she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning 
 times pass . 

 “ i ca n't come , ” she said apologetically , “ i have forgotten how to fly . ” 

 “ i 'll soon teach you again . ” 

 “ o peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ” 

 she had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him . “ what is it ? ” he 
 cried , shrinking . 

 “ i will turn up the light , ” she said , “ and then you can see for 
 yourself . ” 

 for almost the only time in his life that i know of , peter was afraid . 
 “ do n't turn up the light , ” he cried . 

 she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy . she was not a 
 little girl heart - broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it 
 all , but they were wet - eyed smiles . 

 then she turned up the light , and peter saw . he gave a cry of pain ; and 
 when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew 
 back sharply . 

 “ what is it ? ” he cried again . 

 she had to tell him . 

 “ i am old , peter . i am ever so much more than twenty . i grew up long 
 ago . ” 

 “ you promised not to ! ” 

 “ i could n't help it . i am a married woman , peter . ” 

 “ no , you 're not . ” 

 “ yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ” 

 “ no , she 's not . ” 

 but he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child 
 with his dagger upraised . of course he did not strike . he sat down on 
 the floor instead and sobbed ; and wendy did not know how to comfort him , 
 though she could have done it so easily once . she was only a woman now , 
 and she ran out of the room to try to think . 

 peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke jane . she sat up in bed , 
 and was interested at once . 

 “ boy , ” she said , “ why are you crying ? ” 

 peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed . 

 “ hullo , ” he said . 

 “ hullo , ” said jane . 

 “ my name is peter pan , ” he told her . 

 “ yes , i know . ” 

 “ i came back for my mother , ” he explained , “ to take her to the 
 neverland . ” 

 “ yes , i know , ” jane said , “ i have been waiting for you . ” 

 when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed - post 
 crowing gloriously , while jane in her nighty was flying round the room 
 in solemn ecstasy . 

 “ she is my mother , ” peter explained ; and jane descended and stood by his 
 side , with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they 
 gazed at him . 

 “ he does so need a mother , ” jane said . 

 “ yes , i know , ” wendy admitted rather forlornly ; “ no one knows it so well 
 as i. ” 

 “ good - bye , ” said peter to wendy ; and he rose in the air , and the 
 shameless jane rose with him ; it was already her easiest way of moving 
 about . 

 wendy rushed to the window . 

 “ no , no , ” she cried . 

 “ it is just for spring cleaning time , ” jane said , “ he wants me always to 
 do his spring cleaning . ” 

 “ if only i could go with you , ” wendy sighed . 

 “ you see you ca n't fly , ” said jane . 

 of course in the end wendy let them fly away together . our last glimpse 
 of her shows her at the window , watching them receding into the sky 
 until they were as small as stars . 

 as you look at wendy , you may see her hair becoming white , and her 
 figure little again , for all this happened long ago . jane is now a 
 common grown - up , with a daughter called margaret ; and every spring 
 cleaning time , except when he forgets , peter comes for margaret and 
 takes her to the neverland , where she tells him stories about himself , 
 to which he listens eagerly . when margaret grows up she will have a 
 daughter , who is to be peter 's mother in turn ; and thus it will go on , 
 so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless .

 section 4 .   information about donations to the project gutenberg 
 literary archive foundation 

 project gutenberg - tm depends upon and can not survive without wide 
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of 
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be 
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest 
 array of equipment including outdated equipment .   many small donations 
 ( $ 1 to $ 5,000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt 
 status with the irs . 

 the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating 
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united 
 states .   compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a 
 considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 
 with these requirements .   we do not solicit donations in locations 
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .   to 
 send donations or determine the status of compliance for any 
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org 

 while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we 
 have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition 
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who 
 approach us with offers to donate . 

 international donations are gratefully accepted , but we can not make 
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from 
 outside the united states .   u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff . 

 please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation 
 methods and addresses .   donations are accepted in a number of other 
 ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .

 section 5 .   general information about project gutenberg - tm electronic 
 works . 

 professor michael s. hart is the originator of the project gutenberg - tm 
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared 
 with anyone .   for thirty years , he produced and distributed project 
 gutenberg - tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support . 

 project gutenberg - tm ebooks are often created from several printed 
 editions , all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s. 
 unless a copyright notice is included .   thus , we do not necessarily 
 keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition . 

 each ebook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook 's 
 ebook number , often in several formats including plain vanilla ascii , 
 compressed ( zipped ) , html and others . 

 corrected editions of our ebooks replace the old file and take over 
 the old filename and etext number .   the replaced older file is renamed . 
 versions based on separate sources are treated as new ebooks receiving 
 new filenames and etext numbers . 

 most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility : 

 http://www.gutenberg.org 

 this web site includes information about project gutenberg - tm , 
 including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary 
 archive foundation , how to help produce our new ebooks , and how to 
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks . 

 ebooks posted prior to november 2003 , with ebook numbers below # 10000 , 
 are filed in directories based on their release date .   if you want to 
 download any of these ebooks directly , rather than using the regular 
 search system you may utilize the following addresses and just 
 download by the etext year . 

 http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06 

     ( or /etext 05 , 04 , 03 , 02 , 01 , 00 , 99 , 
      98 , 97 , 96 , 95 , 94 , 93 , 92 , 92 , 91 or 90 ) 

 ebooks posted since november 2003 , with etext numbers over # 10000 , are 
 filed in a different way .   the year of a release date is no longer part 
 of the directory path .   the path is based on the etext number ( which is 
 identical to the filename ) .   the path to the file is made up of single 
 digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename .   for 
 example an ebook of filename 10234 would be found at : 

 http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234 

 or filename 24689 would be found at :

 preface 

 most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred ; one or two 
 were experiences of my own , the rest those of boys who were schoolmates 
 of mine . huck finn is drawn from life ; tom sawyer also , but not from an 
 individual -- he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom 
 i knew , and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture . 

 the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and 
 slaves in the west at the period of this story -- that is to say , thirty or 
 forty years ago . 

 although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and 
 girls , i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account , 
 for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what 
 they once were themselves , and of how they felt and thought and talked , 
 and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in .

 chapter i 

 “ tom ! ” 

 no answer . 

 “ tom ! ” 

 no answer . 

 “ what 's gone with that boy ,   i wonder ? you tom ! ” 

 no answer . 

 the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the 
 room ; then she put them up and looked out under them . she seldom or 
 never looked _ through _ them for so small a thing as a boy ; they were 
 her state pair , the pride of her heart , and were built for “ style , ” not 
 service -- she could have seen through a pair of stove - lids just as well . 
 she looked perplexed for a moment , and then said , not fiercely , but 
 still loud enough for the furniture to hear : 

 “ well , i lay if i get hold of you i'll-- ” 

 she did not finish , for by this time she was bending down and punching 
 under the bed with the broom , and so she needed breath to punctuate the 
 punches with . she resurrected nothing but the cat . 

 “ i never did see the beat of that boy ! ” 

 she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the 
 tomato vines and “ jimpson ” weeds that constituted the garden . no tom . so 
 she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted : 

 “ y - o - u - u tom ! ” 

 there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize 
 a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight . 

 “ there ! i might ' a ' thought of that closet . what you been doing in 
 there ? ” 

 “ nothing . ” 

 “ nothing ! look at your hands . and look at your mouth . what _ is _ that 
 truck ? ” 

 “ i do n't know , aunt . ” 

 “ well , i know . it 's jam -- that 's what it is . forty times i 've said if you 
 did n't let that jam alone i 'd skin you . hand me that switch . ” 

 the switch hovered in the air -- the peril was desperate-- 

 “ my ! look behind you , aunt ! ” 

 the old lady whirled round , and snatched her skirts out of danger . 
 the lad fled on the instant , scrambled up the high board - fence , and 
 disappeared over it . 

 his aunt polly stood surprised a moment , and then broke into a gentle 
 laugh . 

 “ hang the boy , ca n't i never learn anything ? ai n't he played me tricks 
 enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time ? but old 
 fools is the biggest fools there is . ca n't learn an old dog new tricks , 
 as the saying is . but my goodness , he never plays them alike , two days , 
 and how is a body to know what 's coming ? he ' pears to know just how long 
 he can torment me before i get my dander up , and he knows if he can make 
 out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and 
 i ca n't hit him a lick . i ai n't doing my duty by that boy , and that 's 
 the lord 's truth , goodness knows . spare the rod and spile the child , 
 as the good book says . i 'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both , 
 i know . he 's full of the old scratch , but laws - a - me ! he 's my own 
 dead sister 's boy , poor thing , and i ai n't got the heart to lash him , 
 somehow . every time i let him off , my conscience does hurt me so , and 
 every time i hit him my old heart most breaks . well - a - well , man that is 
 born of woman is of few days and full of trouble , as the scripture 
 says , and i reckon it 's so . he 'll play hookey this evening , * and [ * 
 southwestern for “ afternoon ” ] i 'll just be obleeged to make him work , 
 tomorrow , to punish him . it 's mighty hard to make him work saturdays , 
 when all the boys is having holiday , but he hates work more than he 
 hates anything else , and i 've _ got _ to do some of my duty by him , or 
 i 'll be the ruination of the child . ” 

 tom did play hookey , and he had a very good time . he got back home 
 barely in season to help jim , the small colored boy , saw next - day 's wood 
 and split the kindlings before supper -- at least he was there in time 
 to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three - fourths of the work . 
 tom 's younger brother ( or rather half - brother ) sid was already through 
 with his part of the work ( picking up chips ) , for he was a quiet boy , 
 and had no adventurous , trouble - some ways . 

 while tom was eating his supper , and stealing sugar as opportunity 
 offered , aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile , and 
 very deep -- for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments . like 
 many other simple - hearted souls , it was her pet vanity to believe she 
 was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy , and she 
 loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low 
 cunning . said she : 

 “ tom , it was middling warm in school , warn't it ? ” 

 “ yes'm . ” 

 “ powerful warm , warn't it ? ” 

 “ yes'm . ” 

 “ did n't you want to go in a - swimming , tom ? ” 

 a bit of a scare shot through tom -- a touch of uncomfortable suspicion . he 
 searched aunt polly 's face , but it told him nothing . so he said : 

 “ no'm -- well , not very much . ” 

 the old lady reached out her hand and felt tom 's shirt , and said : 

 “ but you ai n't too warm now , though . ” and it flattered her to reflect 
 that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing 
 that that was what she had in her mind . but in spite of her , tom knew 
 where the wind lay , now . so he forestalled what might be the next move : 

 “ some of us pumped on our heads -- mine 's damp yet . see ? ” 

 aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of 
 circumstantial evidence , and missed a trick . then she had a new 
 inspiration : 

 “ tom , you did n't have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it , to 
 pump on your head , did you ? unbutton your jacket ! ” 

 the trouble vanished out of tom 's face . he opened his jacket . his shirt 
 collar was securely sewed . 

 “ bother ! well , go ' long with you . i 'd made sure you 'd played hookey 
 and been a - swimming . but i forgive ye , tom . i reckon you 're a kind of a 
 singed cat , as the saying is -- better'n you look . _ this _ time . ” 

 she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried , and half glad that tom 
 had stumbled into obedient conduct for once . 

 but sidney said : 

 “ well , now , if i did n't think you sewed his collar with white thread , 
 but it 's black . ” 

 “ why , i did sew it with white ! tom ! ” 

 but tom did not wait for the rest . as he went out at the door he said : 

 “ siddy , i 'll lick you for that . ” 

 in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into 
 the lapels of his jacket , and had thread bound about them -- one needle 
 carried white thread and the other black . he said : 

 “ she 'd never noticed if it had n't been for sid . confound it ! sometimes 
 she sews it with white , and sometimes she sews it with black . i wish to 
 gee - miny she 'd stick to one or t'other -- i ca n't keep the run of 'em . but 
 i bet you i 'll lam sid for that . i 'll learn him ! ” 

 he was not the model boy of the village . he knew the model boy very well 
 though -- and loathed him . 

 within two minutes , or even less , he had forgotten all his troubles . not 
 because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a 
 man 's are to a man , but because a new and powerful interest bore 
 them down and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men 's 
 misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises . this new 
 interest was a valued novelty in whistling , which he had just acquired 
 from a negro , and he was suffering to practise it un - disturbed . it 
 consisted in a peculiar bird - like turn , a sort of liquid warble , 
 produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short 
 intervals in the midst of the music -- the reader probably remembers how to 
 do it , if he has ever been a boy . diligence and attention soon gave him 
 the knack of it , and he strode down the street with his mouth full of 
 harmony and his soul full of gratitude . he felt much as an astronomer 
 feels who has discovered a new planet -- no doubt , as far as strong , deep , 
 unalloyed pleasure is concerned , the advantage was with the boy , not the 
 astronomer . 

 the summer evenings were long . it was not dark , yet . presently tom 
 checked his whistle . a stranger was before him -- a boy a shade larger 
 than himself . a new - comer of any age or either sex was an im - pressive 
 curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st. petersburg . this boy 
 was well dressed , too -- well dressed on a week - day . this was simply as 
 astounding . his cap was a dainty thing , his close - buttoned blue cloth 
 roundabout was new and natty , and so were his pantaloons . he had shoes 
 on -- and it was only friday . he even wore a necktie , a bright bit of 
 ribbon . he had a citified air about him that ate into tom 's vitals . the 
 more tom stared at the splendid marvel , the higher he turned up his nose 
 at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to 
 him to grow . neither boy spoke . if one moved , the other moved -- but only 
 sidewise , in a circle ; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the 
 time . finally tom said : 

 “ i can lick you ! ” 

 “ i 'd like to see you try it . ” 

 “ well , i can do it . ” 

 “ no you ca n't , either . ” 

 “ yes i can . ” 

 “ no you ca n't . ” 

 “ i can . ” 

 “ you ca n't . ” 

 “ can ! ” 

 “ ca n't ! ” 

 an uncomfortable pause . then tom said : 

 “ what 's your name ? ” 

 “ ' tisn't any of your business , maybe . ” 

 “ well i ' low i 'll _ make _ it my business . ” 

 “ well why do n't you ? ” 

 “ if you say much , i will . ” 

 “ much -- much--_much_. there now . ” 

 “ oh , you think you 're mighty smart , _ do n't _ you ? i could lick you with 
 one hand tied behind me , if i wanted to . ” 

 “ well why do n't you _ do _ it ? you _ say _ you can do it . ” 

 “ well i _ will _ , if you fool with me . ” 

 “ oh yes -- i've seen whole families in the same fix . ” 

 “ smarty ! you think you 're _ some _ , now , _ do n't _ you ? oh , what a hat ! ” 

 “ you can lump that hat if you do n't like it . i dare you to knock it 
 off -- and anybody that 'll take a dare will suck eggs . ” 

 “ you 're a liar ! ” 

 “ you 're another . ” 

 “ you 're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up . ” 

 “ aw -- take a walk ! ” 

 “ say -- if you give me much more of your sass i 'll take and bounce a rock 
 off'n your head . ” 

 “ oh , of _ course _ you will . ” 

 “ well i _ will_. ” 

 “ well why do n't you _ do _ it then ? what do you keep _ saying _ you will 
 for ? why do n't you _ do _ it ? it 's because you 're afraid . ” 

 “ i _ ai n't _ afraid . ” 

 “ you are . ” 

 “ i ai n't . ” 

 “ you are . ” 

 another pause , and more eying and sidling around each other . presently 
 they were shoulder to shoulder . tom said : 

 “ get away from here ! ” 

 “ go away yourself ! ” 

 “ i wo n't . ” 

 “ i wo n't either . ” 

 so they stood , each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace , and both 
 shoving with might and main , and glowering at each other with hate . but 
 neither could get an advantage . after struggling till both were hot and 
 flushed , each relaxed his strain with watchful caution , and tom said : 

 “ you 're a coward and a pup . i 'll tell my big brother on you , and he can 
 thrash you with his little finger , and i 'll make him do it , too . ” 

 “ what do i care for your big brother ? i 've got a brother that 's bigger 
 than he is -- and what 's more , he can throw him over that fence , too . ” 
  [ both brothers were imaginary . ] 

 “ that 's a lie . ” 

 “ _ your _ saying so do n't make it so . ” 

 tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe , and said : 

 “ i dare you to step over that , and i 'll lick you till you ca n't stand 
 up . anybody that 'll take a dare will steal sheep . ” 

 the new boy stepped over promptly , and said : 

 “ now you said you 'd do it , now let 's see you do it . ” 

 “ do n't you crowd me now ; you better look out . ” 

 “ well , you _ said _ you 'd do it -- why do n't you do it ? ” 

 “ by jingo ! for two cents i _ will _ do it . ” 

 the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out 
 with derision . tom struck them to the ground . in an instant both boys 
 were rolling and tumbling in the dirt , gripped together like cats ; and 
 for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other 's hair and 
 clothes , punched and scratched each other 's nose , and covered themselves 
 with dust and glory . presently the confusion took form , and through the 
 fog of battle tom appeared , seated astride the new boy , and pounding him 
 with his fists . “ holler ' nuff ! ” said he . 

 the boy only struggled to free himself . he was crying -- mainly from rage . 

 “ holler ' nuff!”--and the pounding went on . 

 at last the stranger got out a smothered “ ' nuff ! ” and tom let him up and 
 said : 

 “ now that 'll learn you . better look out who you 're fooling with next 
 time . ” 

 the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes , sobbing , 
 snuffling , and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and 
 threatening what he would do to tom the “ next time he caught him out . ” 
  to which tom responded with jeers , and started off in high feather , and 
 as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone , threw it 
 and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like 
 an antelope . tom chased the traitor home , and thus found out where he 
 lived . he then held a position at the gate for some time , daring the 
 enemy to come outside , but the enemy only made faces at him through the 
 window and declined . at last the enemy 's mother appeared , and called tom 
 a bad , vicious , vulgar child , and ordered him away . so he went away ; but 
 he said he “ ' lowed ” to “ lay ” for that boy . 

 he got home pretty late that night , and when he climbed cautiously in 
 at the window , he uncovered an ambuscade , in the person of his aunt ; and 
 when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his 
 saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its 
 firmness . 




 chapter ii 

 saturday morning was come , and all the summer world was bright and 
 fresh , and brimming with life . there was a song in every heart ; and if 
 the heart was young the music issued at the lips . there was cheer in 
 every face and a spring in every step . the locust - trees were in bloom 
 and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air . cardiff hill , beyond 
 the village and above it , was green with vegetation and it lay just far 
 enough away to seem a delectable land , dreamy , reposeful , and inviting . 

 tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a 
 long - handled brush . he surveyed the fence , and all gladness left him and 
 a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit . thirty yards of board 
 fence nine feet high . life to him seemed hollow , and existence but a 
 burden . sighing , he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost 
 plank ; repeated the operation ; did it again ; compared the insignificant 
 whitewashed streak with the far - reaching continent of unwhitewashed 
 fence , and sat down on a tree - box discouraged . jim came skipping out at 
 the gate with a tin pail , and singing buffalo gals . bringing water from 
 the town pump had always been hateful work in tom 's eyes , before , but 
 now it did not strike him so . he remembered that there was company at 
 the pump . white , mulatto , and negro boys and girls were always there 
 waiting their turns , resting , trading playthings , quarrelling , fighting , 
 skylarking . and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred 
 and fifty yards off , jim never got back with a bucket of water under an 
 hour -- and even then somebody generally had to go after him . tom said : 

 “ say , jim , i 'll fetch the water if you 'll whitewash some . ” 

 jim shook his head and said : 

 “ ca n't , mars tom . ole missis , she tole me i got to go an ' git dis water 
 an ' not stop foolin ' roun ' wid anybody . she say she spec ' mars tom gwine 
 to ax me to whitewash , an ' so she tole me go ' long an ' ' tend to my own 
 business -- she ' lowed _ she 'd _ ' tend to de whitewashin ' . ” 

 “ oh , never you mind what she said , jim . that 's the way she always talks . 
 gimme the bucket -- i wo n't be gone only a a minute . _ she _ wo n't ever 
 know . ” 

 “ oh , i dasn't , mars tom . ole missis she 'd take an ' tar de head off'n me . 
 ' deed she would . ” 

 “ _ she _ ! she never licks anybody -- whacks 'em over the head with her 
 thimble -- and who cares for that , i 'd like to know . she talks awful , but 
 talk do n't hurt -- anyways it do n't if she do n't cry . jim , i 'll give you a 
 marvel . i 'll give you a white alley ! ” 

 jim began to waver . 

 “ white alley , jim ! and it 's a bully taw . ” 

 “ my ! dat 's a mighty gay marvel , i tell you ! but mars tom i 's powerful 
 ' fraid ole missis-- ” 

 “ and besides , if you will i 'll show you my sore toe . ” 

 jim was only human -- this attraction was too much for him . he put down 
 his pail , took the white alley , and bent over the toe with absorbing 
 interest while the bandage was being unwound . in another moment he 
 was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear , tom was 
 whitewashing with vigor , and aunt polly was retiring from the field with 
 a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye . 

 but tom 's energy did not last . he began to think of the fun he had 
 planned for this day , and his sorrows multiplied . soon the free boys 
 would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions , and 
 they would make a world of fun of him for having to work -- the very 
 thought of it burnt him like fire . he got out his worldly wealth and 
 examined it -- bits of toys , marbles , and trash ; enough to buy an exchange 
 of _ work _ , maybe , but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour 
 of pure freedom . so he returned his straitened means to his pocket , and 
 gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys . at this dark and hopeless 
 moment an inspiration burst upon him ! nothing less than a great , 
 magnificent inspiration . 

 he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work . ben rogers hove in 
 sight presently -- the very boy , of all boys , whose ridicule he had been 
 dreading . ben 's gait was the hop - skip - and - jump -- proof enough that his 
 heart was light and his anticipations high . he was eating an apple , and 
 giving a long , melodious whoop , at intervals , followed by a deep - toned 
 ding - dong - dong , ding - dong - dong , for he was personating a steamboat . as 
 he drew near , he slackened speed , took the middle of the street , leaned 
 far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp 
 and circumstance -- for he was personating the big missouri , and considered 
 himself to be drawing nine feet of water . he was boat and captain and 
 engine - bells combined , so he had to imagine himself standing on his own 
 hurricane - deck giving the orders and executing them : 

 “ stop her , sir ! ting - a - ling - ling ! ” the headway ran almost out , and he 
 drew up slowly toward the sidewalk . 

 “ ship up to back ! ting - a - ling - ling ! ” his arms straightened and stiffened 
 down his sides . 

 “ set her back on the stabboard ! ting - a - ling - ling ! chow ! ch - chow - wow ! 
 chow ! ” his right hand , mean - time , describing stately circles -- for it was 
 representing a forty - foot wheel . 

 “ let her go back on the labboard ! ting - a - ling - ling ! chow - ch - chow - chow ! ” 
  the left hand began to describe circles . 

 “ stop the stabboard ! ting - a - ling - ling ! stop the labboard ! come ahead on 
 the stabboard ! stop her ! let your outside turn over slow ! ting - a - ling - ling ! 
 chow - ow - ow ! get out that head - line ! _ lively _ now ! come -- out with 
 your spring - line -- what're you about there ! take a turn round that stump 
 with the bight of it ! stand by that stage , now -- let her go ! done with 
 the engines , sir ! ting - a - ling - ling ! sh't ! s'h't ! sh't ! ” ( trying the 
 gauge - cocks ) . 

 tom went on whitewashing -- paid no attention to the steamboat . ben stared 
 a moment and then said : “ _ hi - yi ! you 're _ up a stump , ai n't you ! ” 

 no answer . tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist , then 
 he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result , as 
 before . ben ranged up alongside of him . tom 's mouth watered for the 
 apple , but he stuck to his work . ben said : 

 “ hello , old chap , you got to work , hey ? ” 

 tom wheeled suddenly and said : 

 “ why , it 's you , ben ! i warn't noticing . ” 

 “ say -- i'm going in a - swimming , i am . do n't you wish you could ? but of 
 course you 'd druther _ work_--wouldn't you ? course you would ! ” 

 tom contemplated the boy a bit , and said : 

 “ what do you call work ? ” 

 “ why , ai n't _ that _ work ? ” 

 tom resumed his whitewashing , and answered carelessly : 

 “ well , maybe it is , and maybe it ai n't . all i know , is , it suits tom 
 sawyer . ” 

 “ oh come , now , you do n't mean to let on that you _ like _ it ? ” 

 the brush continued to move . 

 “ like it ? well , i do n't see why i ought n't to like it . does a boy get a 
 chance to whitewash a fence every day ? ” 

 that put the thing in a new light . ben stopped nibbling his apple . 
 tom swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the 
 effect -- added a touch here and there -- criticised the effect again -- ben 
 watching every move and getting more and more interested , more and more 
 absorbed . presently he said : 

 “ say , tom , let _ me _ whitewash a little . ” 

 tom considered , was about to consent ; but he altered his mind : 

 “ no -- no -- i reckon it would n't hardly do , ben . you see , aunt polly 's awful 
 particular about this fence -- right here on the street , you know -- but if it 
 was the back fence i would n't mind and _ she _ would n't . yes , she 's awful 
 particular about this fence ; it 's got to be done very careful ; i reckon 
 there ai n't one boy in a thousand , maybe two thousand , that can do it 
 the way it 's got to be done . ” 

 “ no -- is that so ? oh come , now -- lemme just try . only just a little -- i'd let 
 _ you _ , if you was me , tom . ” 

 “ ben , i 'd like to , honest injun ; but aunt polly -- well , jim wanted to do 
 it , but she would n't let him ; sid wanted to do it , and she would n't let 
 sid . now do n't you see how i 'm fixed ? if you was to tackle this fence 
 and anything was to happen to it-- ” 

 “ oh , shucks , i 'll be just as careful . now lemme try . say -- i'll give you 
 the core of my apple . ” 

 “ well , here -- no , ben , now do n't . i 'm afeard-- ” 

 “ i 'll give you _ all _ of it ! ” 

 tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face , but alacrity in his 
 heart . and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the 
 sun , the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by , 
 dangled his legs , munched his apple , and planned the slaughter of more 
 innocents . there was no lack of material ; boys happened along every 
 little while ; they came to jeer , but remained to whitewash . by the time 
 ben was fagged out , tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for 
 a kite , in good repair ; and when he played out , johnny miller bought in 
 for a dead rat and a string to swing it with -- and so on , and so on , hour 
 after hour . and when the middle of the afternoon came , from being a 
 poor poverty - stricken boy in the morning , tom was literally rolling in 
 wealth . he had besides the things before mentioned , twelve marbles , part 
 of a jews - harp , a piece of blue bottle - glass to look through , a spool 
 cannon , a key that would n't unlock anything , a fragment of chalk , a 
 glass stopper of a decanter , a tin soldier , a couple of tadpoles , 
 six fire - crackers , a kitten with only one eye , a brass door - knob , a 
 dog - collar -- but no dog -- the handle of a knife , four pieces of orange - peel , 
 and a dilapidated old window sash . 

 he had had a nice , good , idle time all the while -- plenty of company -- and 
 the fence had three coats of whitewash on it ! if he had n't run out of 
 whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village . 

 tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world , after all . he 
 had discovered a great law of human action , without knowing it -- namely , 
 that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing , it is only necessary 
 to make the thing difficult to attain . if he had been a great and 
 wise philosopher , like the writer of this book , he would now have 
 comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is _ obliged _ to do , 
 and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do . and 
 this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or 
 performing on a tread - mill is work , while rolling ten - pins or climbing 
 mont blanc is only amusement . there are wealthy gentlemen in england 
 who drive four - horse passenger - coaches twenty or thirty miles on a 
 daily line , in the summer , because the privilege costs them considerable 
 money ; but if they were offered wages for the service , that would turn 
 it into work and then they would resign . 

 the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place 
 in his worldly circumstances , and then wended toward headquarters to 
 report . 




 chapter iii 

 tom presented himself before aunt polly , who was sitting by an 
 open window in a pleasant rearward apartment , which was bedroom , 
 breakfast - room , dining - room , and library , combined . the balmy summer 
 air , the restful quiet , the odor of the flowers , and the drowsing 
 murmur of the bees had had their effect , and she was nodding over her 
 knitting -- for she had no company but the cat , and it was asleep in her 
 lap . her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety . she had 
 thought that of course tom had deserted long ago , and she wondered at 
 seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way . he 
 said : “ may n't i go and play now , aunt ? ” 

 “ what , a'ready ? how much have you done ? ” 

 “ it 's all done , aunt . ” 

 “ tom , do n't lie to me -- i ca n't bear it . ” 

 “ i ai n't , aunt ; it _ is _ all done . ” 

 aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence . she went out to see for 
 herself ; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent . of 
 tom 's statement true . when she found the entire fence white - washed , and 
 not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated , and even a 
 streak added to the ground , her astonishment was almost unspeakable . she 
 said : 

 “ well , i never ! there 's no getting round it , you can work when you 're a 
 mind to , tom . ” and then she diluted the compliment by adding , “ but it 's 
 powerful seldom you 're a mind to , i 'm bound to say . well , go ' long and 
 play ; but mind you get back some time in a week , or i 'll tan you . ” 

 she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took 
 him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him , 
 along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat 
 took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort . 
 and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish , he “ hooked ” a 
 doughnut . 

 then he skipped out , and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway 
 that led to the back rooms on the second floor . clods were handy and 
 the air was full of them in a twinkling . they raged around sid like a 
 hail - storm ; and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties 
 and sally to the rescue , six or seven clods had taken personal effect , 
 and tom was over the fence and gone . there was a gate , but as a general 
 thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it . his soul was at 
 peace , now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his 
 black thread and getting him into trouble . 

 tom skirted the block , and came round into a muddy alley that led by the 
 back of his aunt 's cow - stable . he presently got safely beyond the reach 
 of capture and punishment , and hastened toward the public square of the 
 village , where two “ military ” companies of boys had met for conflict , 
 according to previous appointment . tom was general of one of these 
 armies , joe harper ( a bosom friend ) general of the other . these two 
 great commanders did not condescend to fight in person -- that being better 
 suited to the still smaller fry -- but sat together on an eminence 
 and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through 
 aides - de - camp . tom 's army won a great victory , after a long and 
 hard - fought battle . then the dead were counted , prisoners exchanged , 
 the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon , and the day for the 
 necessary battle appointed ; after which the armies fell into line and 
 marched away , and tom turned homeward alone . 

 as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived , he saw a new 
 girl in the garden -- a lovely little blue - eyed creature with yellow 
 hair plaited into two long - tails , white summer frock and embroidered 
 pan - talettes . the fresh - crowned hero fell without firing a shot . a 
 certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a 
 memory of herself behind . he had thought he loved her to distraction ; 
 he had regarded his passion as adoration ; and behold it was only a poor 
 little evanescent partiality . he had been months winning her ; she had 
 confessed hardly a week ago ; he had been the happiest and the proudest 
 boy in the world only seven short days , and here in one instant of time 
 she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is 
 done . 

 he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye , till he saw that she had 
 discovered him ; then he pretended he did not know she was present , and 
 began to “ show off ” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways , in order to win 
 her admiration . he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time ; 
 but by - and - by , while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic 
 performances , he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending 
 her way toward the house . tom came up to the fence and leaned on it , 
 grieving , and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer . she halted a 
 moment on the steps and then moved toward the door . tom heaved a great 
 sigh as she put her foot on the threshold . but his face lit up , 
 right away , for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she 
 disappeared . 

 the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower , and 
 then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as 
 if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction . 
 presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his 
 nose , with his head tilted far back ; and as he moved from side to side , 
 in his efforts , he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy ; finally his 
 bare foot rested upon it , his pliant toes closed upon it , and he hopped 
 away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner . but only for a 
 minute -- only while he could button the flower inside his jacket , next 
 his heart -- or next his stomach , possibly , for he was not much posted in 
 anatomy , and not hypercritical , anyway . 

 he returned , now , and hung about the fence till nightfall , “ showing 
 off , ” as before ; but the girl never exhibited herself again , though tom 
 comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some 
 window , meantime , and been aware of his attentions . finally he strode 
 home reluctantly , with his poor head full of visions . 

 all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “ what 
 had got into the child . ” he took a good scolding about clodding sid , and 
 did not seem to mind it in the least . he tried to steal sugar under his 
 aunt 's very nose , and got his knuckles rapped for it . he said : 

 “ aunt , you do n't whack sid when he takes it . ” 

 “ well , sid do n't torment a body the way you do . you 'd be always into 
 that sugar if i warn't watching you . ” 

 presently she stepped into the kitchen , and sid , happy in his immunity , 
 reached for the sugar - bowl -- a sort of glorying over tom which was 
 wellnigh unbearable . but sid 's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and 
 broke . tom was in ecstasies . in such ecstasies that he even controlled 
 his tongue and was silent . he said to himself that he would not speak a 
 word , even when his aunt came in , but would sit perfectly still till she 
 asked who did the mischief ; and then he would tell , and there would be 
 nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “ catch it . ” he was 
 so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old 
 lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath 
 from over her spectacles . he said to himself , “ now it 's coming ! ” and the 
 next instant he was sprawling on the floor ! the potent palm was uplifted 
 to strike again when tom cried out : 

 “ hold on , now , what ' er you belting _ me _ for ?-- sid broke it ! ” 

 aunt polly paused , perplexed , and tom looked for healing pity . but when 
 she got her tongue again , she only said : 

 “ umf ! well , you did n't get a lick amiss , i reckon . you been into some 
 other audacious mischief when i was n't around , like enough . ” 

 then her conscience reproached her , and she yearned to say something 
 kind and loving ; but she judged that this would be construed into a 
 confession that she had been in the wrong , and discipline forbade that . 
 so she kept silence , and went about her affairs with a troubled heart . 
 tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes . he knew that in her heart 
 his aunt was on her knees to him , and he was morosely gratified by the 
 consciousness of it . he would hang out no signals , he would take notice 
 of none . he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him , now and then , 
 through a film of tears , but he refused recognition of it . he pictured 
 himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching 
 one little forgiving word , but he would turn his face to the wall , and 
 die with that word unsaid . ah , how would she feel then ? and he pictured 
 himself brought home from the river , dead , with his curls all wet , and 
 his sore heart at rest . how she would throw herself upon him , and how 
 her tears would fall like rain , and her lips pray god to give her back 
 her boy and she would never , never abuse him any more ! but he would 
 lie there cold and white and make no sign -- a poor little sufferer , whose 
 griefs were at an end . he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of 
 these dreams , that he had to keep swallowing , he was so like to choke ; 
 and his eyes swam in a blur of water , which overflowed when he winked , 
 and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose . and such a luxury to 
 him was this petting of his sorrows , that he could not bear to have any 
 worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it ; it was too 
 sacred for such contact ; and so , presently , when his cousin mary danced 
 in , all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age - long visit 
 of one week to the country , he got up and moved in clouds and darkness 
 out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other . 

 he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys , and sought desolate 
 places that were in harmony with his spirit . a log raft in the river 
 invited him , and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated 
 the dreary vastness of the stream , wishing , the while , that he could 
 only be drowned , all at once and unconsciously , without undergoing the 
 uncomfortable routine devised by nature . then he thought of his flower . 
 he got it out , rumpled and wilted , and it mightily increased his dismal 
 felicity . he wondered if she would pity him if she knew ? would she 
 cry , and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and 
 comfort him ? or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world ? 
 this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he 
 worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and 
 varied lights , till he wore it threadbare . at last he rose up sighing 
 and departed in the darkness . 

 about half - past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to 
 where the adored unknown lived ; he paused a moment ; no sound fell upon 
 his listening ear ; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain 
 of a second - story window . was the sacred presence there ? he climbed the 
 fence , threaded his stealthy way through the plants , till he stood under 
 that window ; he looked up at it long , and with emotion ; then he laid him 
 down on the ground under it , disposing himself upon his back , with his 
 hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower . 
 and thus he would die -- out in the cold world , with no shelter over his 
 homeless head , no friendly hand to wipe the death - damps from his brow , 
 no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came . and 
 thus _ she _ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning , and 
 oh ! would she drop one little tear upon his poor , lifeless form , would 
 she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted , 
 so untimely cut down ? 

 the window went up , a maid - servant 's discordant voice profaned the holy 
 calm , and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr 's remains ! 

 the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort . there was a whiz 
 as of a missile in the air , mingled with the murmur of a curse , a sound 
 as of shivering glass followed , and a small , vague form went over the 
 fence and shot away in the gloom . 

 not long after , as tom , all undressed for bed , was surveying his 
 drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip , sid woke up ; but if he 
 had any dim idea of making any “ references to allusions , ” he thought 
 better of it and held his peace , for there was danger in tom 's eye . 

 tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers , and sid made mental 
 note of the omission . 




 chapter iv 

 the sun rose upon a tranquil world , and beamed down upon the peaceful 
 village like a benediction . breakfast over , aunt polly had family 
 worship : it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid 
 courses of scriptural quotations , welded together with a thin mortar of 
 originality ; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of 
 the mosaic law , as from sinai . 

 then tom girded up his loins , so to speak , and went to work to “ get 
 his verses . ” sid had learned his lesson days before . tom bent all his 
 energies to the memorizing of five verses , and he chose part of the 
 sermon on the mount , because he could find no verses that were shorter . 
 at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson , 
 but no more , for his mind was traversing the whole field of human 
 thought , and his hands were busy with distracting recreations . mary took 
 his book to hear him recite , and he tried to find his way through the 
 fog : 

 “ blessed are the -- a -- a-- ” 

 “ poor”-- 

 “ yes -- poor ; blessed are the poor -- a -- a-- ” 

 “ in spirit-- ” 

 “ in spirit ; blessed are the poor in spirit , for they -- they-- ” 

 “ _ theirs_-- ” 

 “ for _ theirs_. blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom 
 of heaven . blessed are they that mourn , for they -- they-- ” 

 “ sh-- ” 

 “ for they -- a-- ” 

 “ s , h , a-- ” 

 “ for they s , h -- oh , i do n't know what it is ! ” 

 “ _ shall _ ! ” 

 “ oh , _ shall _ ! for they shall -- for they shall -- a -- a -- shall mourn -- a -- a -- blessed 
 are they that shall -- they that -- a -- they that shall mourn , for they 
 shall -- a -- shall _ what _ ? why do n't you tell me , mary ?-- what do you want to 
 be so mean for ? ” 

 “ oh , tom , you poor thick - headed thing , i 'm not teasing you . i would n't 
 do that . you must go and learn it again . do n't you be discouraged , tom , 
 you 'll manage it -- and if you do , i 'll give you something ever so nice . 
 there , now , that 's a good boy . ” 

 “ all right ! what is it , mary , tell me what it is . ” 

 “ never you mind , tom . you know if i say it 's nice , it is nice . ” 

 “ you bet you that 's so , mary . all right , i 'll tackle it again . ” 

 and he did “ tackle it again”--and under the double pressure of curiosity 
 and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a 
 shining success . mary gave him a brand - new “ barlow ” knife worth twelve 
 and a half cents ; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system 
 shook him to his foundations . true , the knife would not cut anything , 
 but it was a “ sure - enough ” barlow , and there was inconceivable grandeur 
 in that -- though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a 
 weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing 
 mystery and will always remain so , perhaps . tom contrived to scarify the 
 cupboard with it , and was arranging to begin on the bureau , when he was 
 called off to dress for sunday - school . 

 mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap , and he went 
 outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there ; then he 
 dipped the soap in the water and laid it down ; turned up his sleeves ; 
 poured out the water on the ground , gently , and then entered the kitchen 
 and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door . but 
 mary removed the towel and said : 

 “ now ai n't you ashamed , tom . you must n't be so bad . water wo n't hurt 
 you . ” 

 tom was a trifle disconcerted . the basin was refilled , and this time he 
 stood over it a little while , gathering resolution ; took in a big breath 
 and began . when he entered the kitchen presently , with both eyes shut 
 and groping for the towel with his hands , an honorable testimony of 
 suds and water was dripping from his face . but when he emerged from 
 the towel , he was not yet satisfactory , for the clean territory stopped 
 short at his chin and his jaws , like a mask ; below and beyond this line 
 there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in 
 front and backward around his neck . mary took him in hand , and when she 
 was done with him he was a man and a brother , without distinction of 
 color , and his saturated hair was neatly brushed , and its short curls 
 wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect . [ he privately 
 smoothed out the curls , with labor and difficulty , and plastered his 
 hair close down to his head ; for he held curls to be effeminate , and his 
 own filled his life with bitterness . ] then mary got out a suit of his 
 clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years -- they were 
 simply called his “ other clothes”--and so by that we know the size of his 
 wardrobe . the girl “ put him to rights ” after he had dressed himself ; 
 she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin , turned his vast shirt 
 collar down over his shoulders , brushed him off and crowned him with 
 his speckled straw hat . he now looked exceedingly improved and 
 uncomfortable . he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked ; for there 
 was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him . he 
 hoped that mary would forget his shoes , but the hope was blighted ; she 
 coated them thoroughly with tallow , as was the custom , and brought 
 them out . he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do 
 everything he did n't want to do . but mary said , persuasively : 

 “ please , tom -- that 's a good boy . ” 

 so he got into the shoes snarling . mary was soon ready , and the three 
 children set out for sunday - school -- a place that tom hated with his whole 
 heart ; but sid and mary were fond of it . 

 sabbath - school hours were from nine to half - past ten ; and then church 
 service . two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily , 
 and the other always remained too -- for stronger reasons . the church 's 
 high - backed , uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons ; 
 the edifice was but a small , plain affair , with a sort of pine board 
 tree - box on top of it for a steeple . at the door tom dropped back a step 
 and accosted a sunday - dressed comrade : 

 “ say , billy , got a yaller ticket ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ what 'll you take for her ? ” 

 “ what 'll you give ? ” 

 “ piece of lickrish and a fish - hook . ” 

 “ less see ' em . ” 

 tom exhibited . they were satisfactory , and the property changed hands . 
 then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets , and some 
 small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones . he waylaid other 
 boys as they came , and went on buying tickets of various colors ten 
 or fifteen minutes longer . he entered the church , now , with a swarm 
 of clean and noisy boys and girls , proceeded to his seat and started 
 a quarrel with the first boy that came handy . the teacher , a grave , 
 elderly man , interfered ; then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a 
 boy 's hair in the next bench , and was absorbed in his book when the boy 
 turned around ; stuck a pin in another boy , presently , in order to hear 
 him say “ ouch ! ” and got a new reprimand from his teacher . tom 's whole 
 class were of a pattern -- restless , noisy , and troublesome . when they came 
 to recite their lessons , not one of them knew his verses perfectly , but 
 had to be prompted all along . however , they worried through , and each 
 got his reward -- in small blue tickets , each with a passage of scripture 
 on it ; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation . ten 
 blue tickets equalled a red one , and could be exchanged for it ; ten red 
 tickets equalled a yellow one ; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent 
 gave a very plainly bound bible ( worth forty cents in those easy 
 times ) to the pupil . how many of my readers would have the industry and 
 application to memorize two thousand verses , even for a dore bible ? and 
 yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way -- it was the patient work of 
 two years -- and a boy of german parentage had won four or five . he once 
 recited three thousand verses without stopping ; but the strain upon his 
 mental faculties was too great , and he was little better than an idiot 
 from that day forth -- a grievous misfortune for the school , for on great 
 occasions , before company , the superintendent ( as tom expressed it ) 
 had always made this boy come out and “ spread himself . ” only the older 
 pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work 
 long enough to get a bible , and so the delivery of one of these prizes 
 was a rare and noteworthy circumstance ; the successful pupil was so 
 great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar 's 
 heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple 
 of weeks . it is possible that tom 's mental stomach had never really 
 hungered for one of those prizes , but unquestionably his entire being 
 had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it . 

 in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit , with 
 a closed hymn - book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its 
 leaves , and commanded attention . when a sunday - school superintendent 
 makes his customary little speech , a hymn - book in the hand is as 
 necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer 
 who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert -- though 
 why , is a mystery : for neither the hymn - book nor the sheet of music 
 is ever referred to by the sufferer . this superintendent was a slim 
 creature of thirty - five , with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair ; he 
 wore a stiff standing - collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears 
 and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth -- a 
 fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead , and a turning of the 
 whole body when a side view was required ; his chin was propped on a 
 spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank - note , and had 
 fringed ends ; his boot toes were turned sharply up , in the fashion 
 of the day , like sleigh - runners -- an effect patiently and laboriously 
 produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a 
 wall for hours together . mr. walters was very earnest of mien , and very 
 sincere and honest at heart ; and he held sacred things and places 
 in such reverence , and so separated them from worldly matters , that 
 unconsciously to himself his sunday - school voice had acquired a peculiar 
 intonation which was wholly absent on week - days . he began after this 
 fashion : 

 “ now , children , i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as 
 you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two . there -- that 
 is it . that is the way good little boys and girls should do . i see one 
 little girl who is looking out of the window -- i am afraid she thinks i 
 am out there somewhere -- perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech 
 to the little birds . [ applausive titter . ] i want to tell you how good it 
 makes me feel to see so many bright , clean little faces assembled in a 
 place like this , learning to do right and be good . ” and so forth and so 
 on . it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration . it was of a 
 pattern which does not vary , and so it is familiar to us all . 

 the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights 
 and other recreations among certain of the bad boys , and by fidgetings 
 and whisperings that extended far and wide , washing even to the bases of 
 isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary . but now every sound 
 ceased suddenly , with the subsidence of mr. walters ' voice , and the 
 conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude . 

 a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was 
 more or less rare -- the entrance of visitors : lawyer thatcher , accompanied 
 by a very feeble and aged man ; a fine , portly , middle - aged gentleman 
 with iron - gray hair ; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter 's 
 wife . the lady was leading a child . tom had been restless and full of 
 chafings and repinings ; conscience - smitten , too -- he could not meet amy 
 lawrence 's eye , he could not brook her loving gaze . but when he saw this 
 small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment . the next 
 moment he was “ showing off ” with all his might -- cuffing boys , pulling 
 hair , making faces -- in a word , using every art that seemed likely to 
 fascinate a girl and win her applause . his exaltation had but one 
 alloy -- the memory of his humiliation in this angel 's garden -- and that 
 record in sand was fast washing out , under the waves of happiness that 
 were sweeping over it now . 

 the visitors were given the highest seat of honor , and as soon as mr. 
 walters ' speech was finished , he introduced them to the school . the 
 middle - aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage -- no less a one 
 than the county judge -- altogether the most august creation these children 
 had ever looked upon -- and they wondered what kind of material he was made 
 of -- and they half wanted to hear him roar , and were half afraid he might , 
 too . he was from constantinople , twelve miles away -- so he had travelled , 
 and seen the world -- these very eyes had looked upon the county 
 court - house -- which was said to have a tin roof . the awe which these 
 reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the 
 ranks of staring eyes . this was the great judge thatcher , brother of 
 their own lawyer . jeff thatcher immediately went forward , to be familiar 
 with the great man and be envied by the school . it would have been music 
 to his soul to hear the whisperings : 

 “ look at him , jim ! he 's a going up there . say -- look ! he 's a going to 
 shake hands with him -- he _ is _ shaking hands with him ! by jings , do n't you 
 wish you was jeff ? ” 

 mr. walters fell to “ showing off , ” with all sorts of official bustlings 
 and activities , giving orders , delivering judgments , discharging 
 directions here , there , everywhere that he could find a target . the 
 librarian “ showed off”--running hither and thither with his arms full of 
 books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority 
 delights in . the young lady teachers “ showed off”--bending sweetly over 
 pupils that were lately being boxed , lifting pretty warning fingers 
 at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly . the young gentlemen 
 teachers “ showed off ” with small scoldings and other little displays of 
 authority and fine attention to discipline -- and most of the teachers , of 
 both sexes , found business up at the library , by the pulpit ; and it was 
 business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times 
 ( with much seeming vexation ) . the little girls “ showed off ” in various 
 ways , and the little boys “ showed off ” with such diligence that the air 
 was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings . and above it 
 all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all 
 the house , and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur -- for he was 
 “ showing off , ” too . 

 there was only one thing wanting to make mr. walters ' ecstasy complete , 
 and that was a chance to deliver a bible - prize and exhibit a prodigy . 
 several pupils had a few yellow tickets , but none had enough -- he had been 
 around among the star pupils inquiring . he would have given worlds , now , 
 to have that german lad back again with a sound mind . 

 and now at this moment , when hope was dead , tom sawyer came forward with 
 nine yellow tickets , nine red tickets , and ten blue ones , and demanded 
 a bible . this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky . walters was not 
 expecting an application from this source for the next ten years . but 
 there was no getting around it -- here were the certified checks , and they 
 were good for their face . tom was therefore elevated to a place with 
 the judge and the other elect , and the great news was announced from 
 headquarters . it was the most stunning surprise of the decade , and 
 so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the 
 judicial one 's altitude , and the school had two marvels to gaze upon 
 in place of one . the boys were all eaten up with envy -- but those that 
 suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they 
 themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to 
 tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges . 
 these despised themselves , as being the dupes of a wily fraud , a 
 guileful snake in the grass . 

 the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the 
 superintendent could pump up under the circumstances ; but it lacked 
 somewhat of the true gush , for the poor fellow 's instinct taught him 
 that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light , 
 perhaps ; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two 
 thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises -- a dozen would 
 strain his capacity , without a doubt . 

 amy lawrence was proud and glad , and she tried to make tom see it in 
 her face -- but he would n't look . she wondered ; then she was just a grain 
 troubled ; next a dim suspicion came and went -- came again ; she watched ; 
 a furtive glance told her worlds -- and then her heart broke , and she was 
 jealous , and angry , and the tears came and she hated everybody . tom most 
 of all ( she thought ) . 

 tom was introduced to the judge ; but his tongue was tied , his breath 
 would hardly come , his heart quaked -- partly because of the awful 
 greatness of the man , but mainly because he was her parent . he would 
 have liked to fall down and worship him , if it were in the dark . the 
 judge put his hand on tom 's head and called him a fine little man , and 
 asked him what his name was . the boy stammered , gasped , and got it out : 

 “ tom . ” 

 “ oh , no , not tom -- it is-- ” 

 “ thomas . ” 

 “ ah , that 's it . i thought there was more to it , maybe . that 's very well . 
 but you 've another one i daresay , and you 'll tell it to me , wo n't you ? ” 

 “ tell the gentleman your other name , thomas , ” said walters , “ and say 
 sir . you must n't forget your manners . ” 

 “ thomas sawyer -- sir . ” 

 “ that 's it ! that 's a good boy . fine boy . fine , manly little fellow . two 
 thousand verses is a great many -- very , very great many . and you never can 
 be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them ; for knowledge is worth 
 more than anything there is in the world ; it 's what makes great men 
 and good men ; you 'll be a great man and a good man yourself , some 
 day , thomas , and then you 'll look back and say , it 's all owing to the 
 precious sunday - school privileges of my boyhood -- it 's all owing to 
 my dear teachers that taught me to learn -- it 's all owing to the good 
 superintendent , who encouraged me , and watched over me , and gave me a 
 beautiful bible -- a splendid elegant bible -- to keep and have it all for my 
 own , always -- it 's all owing to right bringing up ! that is what you will 
 say , thomas -- and you would n't take any money for those two thousand 
 verses -- no indeed you would n't . and now you would n't mind telling me and 
 this lady some of the things you 've learned -- no , i know you wouldn't -- for 
 we are proud of little boys that learn . now , no doubt you know the names 
 of all the twelve disciples . wo n't you tell us the names of the first 
 two that were appointed ? ” 

 tom was tugging at a button - hole and looking sheepish . he blushed , 
 now , and his eyes fell . mr. walters ' heart sank within him . he said 
 to himself , it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest 
 question -- why _ did _ the judge ask him ? yet he felt obliged to speak up 
 and say : 

 “ answer the gentleman , thomas -- don't be afraid . ” 

 tom still hung fire . 

 “ now i know you 'll tell me , ” said the lady . “ the names of the first two 
 disciples were-- ” 

 “ _ david and goliah ! _ ” 

 let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene . 




 chapter v 

 about half - past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring , 
 and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon . the 
 sunday - school children distributed themselves about the house and 
 occupied pews with their parents , so as to be under supervision . aunt 
 polly came , and tom and sid and mary sat with her -- tom being placed next 
 the aisle , in order that he might be as far away from the open window 
 and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible . the crowd filed up 
 the aisles : the aged and needy postmaster , who had seen better days ; 
 the mayor and his wife -- for they had a mayor there , among other 
 unnecessaries ; the justice of the peace ; the widow douglass , fair , 
 smart , and forty , a generous , good - hearted soul and well - to - do , her hill 
 mansion the only palace in the town , and the most hospitable and much 
 the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st. petersburg could 
 boast ; the bent and venerable major and mrs. ward ; lawyer riverson , the 
 new notable from a distance ; next the belle of the village , followed by 
 a troop of lawn - clad and ribbon - decked young heart - breakers ; then all 
 the young clerks in town in a body -- for they had stood in the vestibule 
 sucking their cane - heads , a circling wall of oiled and simpering 
 admirers , till the last girl had run their gantlet ; and last of all came 
 the model boy , willie mufferson , taking as heedful care of his mother as 
 if she were cut glass . he always brought his mother to church , and was 
 the pride of all the matrons . the boys all hated him , he was so 
 good . and besides , he had been “ thrown up to them ” so much . his 
 white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind , as usual on 
 sundays -- accidentally . tom had no handkerchief , and he looked upon boys 
 who had as snobs . 

 the congregation being fully assembled , now , the bell rang once more , 
 to warn laggards and stragglers , and then a solemn hush fell upon the 
 church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the 
 choir in the gallery . the choir always tittered and whispered all 
 through service . there was once a church choir that was not ill - bred , 
 but i have forgotten where it was , now . it was a great many years ago , 
 and i can scarcely remember anything about it , but i think it was in 
 some foreign country . 

 the minister gave out the hymn , and read it through with a relish , in a 
 peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country . his 
 voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a 
 certain point , where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word 
 and then plunged down as if from a spring - board : 

 shall i be car - ri - ed toe the skies , on flow'ry _ beds _ of ease , 

 whilst others fight to win the prize , and sail thro ' _ blood_-y seas ? 

 he was regarded as a wonderful reader . at church “ sociables ” he was 
 always called upon to read poetry ; and when he was through , the ladies 
 would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps , 
 and “ wall ” their eyes , and shake their heads , as much as to say , “ words 
 can not express it ; it is too beautiful , too beautiful for this mortal 
 earth . ” 

 after the hymn had been sung , the rev. mr. sprague turned himself into 
 a bulletin - board , and read off “ notices ” of meetings and societies and 
 things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of 
 doom -- a queer custom which is still kept up in america , even in cities , 
 away here in this age of abundant newspapers . often , the less there is 
 to justify a traditional custom , the harder it is to get rid of it . 

 and now the minister prayed . a good , generous prayer it was , and went 
 into details : it pleaded for the church , and the little children of the 
 church ; for the other churches of the village ; for the village itself ; 
 for the county ; for the state ; for the state officers ; for the united 
 states ; for the churches of the united states ; for congress ; for the 
 president ; for the officers of the government ; for poor sailors , tossed 
 by stormy seas ; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of 
 european monarchies and oriental despotisms ; for such as have the light 
 and the good tidings , and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear 
 withal ; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea ; and closed with 
 a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace 
 and favor , and be as seed sown in fertile ground , yielding in time a 
 grateful harvest of good . amen . 

 there was a rustling of dresses , and the standing congregation sat down . 
 the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer , he 
 only endured it -- if he even did that much . he was restive all through it ; 
 he kept tally of the details of the prayer , unconsciously -- for he was not 
 listening , but he knew the ground of old , and the clergyman 's regular 
 route over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded , 
 his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it ; he considered 
 additions unfair , and scoundrelly . in the midst of the prayer a fly had 
 lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by 
 calmly rubbing its hands together , embracing its head with its arms , and 
 polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with 
 the body , and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view ; scraping 
 its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they 
 had been coat - tails ; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if 
 it knew it was perfectly safe . as indeed it was ; for as sorely as tom 's 
 hands itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul would 
 be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going 
 on . but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal 
 forward ; and the instant the “ amen ” was out the fly was a prisoner of 
 war . his aunt detected the act and made him let it go . 

 the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an 
 argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod -- and 
 yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and 
 thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly 
 worth the saving . tom counted the pages of the sermon ; after church he 
 always knew how many pages there had been , but he seldom knew anything 
 else about the discourse . however , this time he was really interested 
 for a little while . the minister made a grand and moving picture of the 
 assembling together of the world 's hosts at the millennium when the lion 
 and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead 
 them . but the pathos , the lesson , the moral of the great spectacle 
 were lost upon the boy ; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the 
 principal character before the on - looking nations ; his face lit with the 
 thought , and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child , 
 if it was a tame lion . 

 now he lapsed into suffering again , as the dry argument was resumed . 
 presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out . it was 
 a large black beetle with formidable jaws -- a “ pinchbug , ” he called it . it 
 was in a percussion - cap box . the first thing the beetle did was to 
 take him by the finger . a natural fillip followed , the beetle went 
 floundering into the aisle and lit on its back , and the hurt finger went 
 into the boy 's mouth . the beetle lay there working its helpless legs , 
 unable to turn over . tom eyed it , and longed for it ; but it was safe out 
 of his reach . other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in 
 the beetle , and they eyed it too . presently a vagrant poodle dog came 
 idling along , sad at heart , lazy with the summer softness and the 
 quiet , weary of captivity , sighing for change . he spied the beetle ; the 
 drooping tail lifted and wagged . he surveyed the prize ; walked around 
 it ; smelt at it from a safe distance ; walked around it again ; grew 
 bolder , and took a closer smell ; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly 
 snatch at it , just missing it ; made another , and another ; began to enjoy 
 the diversion ; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws , 
 and continued his experiments ; grew weary at last , and then indifferent 
 and absent - minded . his head nodded , and little by little his chin 
 descended and touched the enemy , who seized it . there was a sharp yelp , 
 a flirt of the poodle 's head , and the beetle fell a couple of yards 
 away , and lit on its back once more . the neighboring spectators 
 shook with a gentle inward joy , several faces went behind fans and 
 hand - kerchiefs , and tom was entirely happy . the dog looked foolish , 
 and probably felt so ; but there was resentment in his heart , too , and a 
 craving for revenge . so he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on 
 it again ; jumping at it from every point of a circle , lighting with his 
 fore - paws within an inch of the creature , making even closer snatches at 
 it with his teeth , and jerking his head till his ears flapped again . but 
 he grew tired once more , after a while ; tried to amuse himself with a 
 fly but found no relief ; followed an ant around , with his nose close 
 to the floor , and quickly wearied of that ; yawned , sighed , forgot the 
 beetle entirely , and sat down on it . then there was a wild yelp of agony 
 and the poodle went sailing up the aisle ; the yelps continued , and so 
 did the dog ; he crossed the house in front of the altar ; he flew 
 down the other aisle ; he crossed before the doors ; he clamored up the 
 home - stretch ; his anguish grew with his progress , till presently he was 
 but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of 
 light . at last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course , and sprang 
 into its master 's lap ; he flung it out of the window , and the voice of 
 distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance . 

 by this time the whole church was red - faced and suffocating with 
 suppressed laughter , and the sermon had come to a dead standstill . 
 the discourse was resumed presently , but it went lame and halting , all 
 possibility of impressiveness being at an end ; for even the gravest 
 sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of 
 unholy mirth , under cover of some remote pew - back , as if the poor parson 
 had said a rarely facetious thing . it was a genuine relief to the whole 
 congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced . 

 tom sawyer went home quite cheerful , thinking to himself that there was 
 some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety 
 in it . he had but one marring thought ; he was willing that the dog 
 should play with his pinchbug , but he did not think it was upright in 
 him to carry it off . 




 chapter vi 

 monday morning found tom sawyer miserable . monday morning always found 
 him so -- because it began another week 's slow suffering in school . he 
 generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday , 
 it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious . 

 tom lay thinking . presently it occurred to him that he wished he was 
 sick ; then he could stay home from school . here was a vague possibility . 
 he canvassed his system . no ailment was found , and he investigated 
 again . this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms , and he 
 began to encourage them with considerable hope . but they soon grew 
 feeble , and presently died wholly away . he reflected further . suddenly 
 he discovered something . one of his upper front teeth was loose . this 
 was lucky ; he was about to begin to groan , as a “ starter , ” as he 
 called it , when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that 
 argument , his aunt would pull it out , and that would hurt . so he thought 
 he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present , and seek further . 
 nothing offered for some little time , and then he remembered hearing 
 the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or 
 three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger . so the boy eagerly 
 drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection . 
 but now he did not know the necessary symptoms . however , it seemed 
 well worth while to chance it , so he fell to groaning with considerable 
 spirit . 

 but sid slept on unconscious . 

 tom groaned louder , and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe . 

 no result from sid . 

 tom was panting with his exertions by this time . he took a rest and then 
 swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans . 

 sid snored on . 

 tom was aggravated . he said , “ sid , sid ! ” and shook him . this course 
 worked well , and tom began to groan again . sid yawned , stretched , then 
 brought himself up on his elbow with a snort , and began to stare at tom . 
 tom went on groaning . sid said : 

 “ tom ! say , tom ! ” [ no response . ] “ here , tom ! tom ! what is the matter , 
 tom ? ” and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously . 

 tom moaned out : 

 “ oh , do n't , sid . do n't joggle me . ” 

 “ why , what 's the matter , tom ? i must call auntie . ” 

 “ no -- never mind . it 'll be over by and by , maybe . do n't call anybody . ” 

 “ but i must ! _ do n't _ groan so , tom , it 's awful . how long you been this 
 way ? ” 

 “ hours . ouch ! oh , do n't stir so , sid , you 'll kill me . ” 

 “ tom , why did n't you wake me sooner ? oh , tom , _ do n't ! _ it makes my flesh 
 crawl to hear you . tom , what is the matter ? ” 

 “ i forgive you everything , sid . [ groan . ] everything you 've ever done to 
 me . when i 'm gone-- ” 

 “ oh , tom , you ai n't dying , are you ? do n't , tom -- oh , do n't . maybe-- ” 

 “ i forgive everybody , sid . [ groan . ] tell 'em so , sid . and sid , you give 
 my window - sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that 's come to 
 town , and tell her-- ” 

 but sid had snatched his clothes and gone . tom was suffering in reality , 
 now , so handsomely was his imagination working , and so his groans had 
 gathered quite a genuine tone . 

 sid flew downstairs and said : 

 “ oh , aunt polly , come ! tom 's dying ! ” 

 “ dying ! ” 

 “ yes'm . do n't wait -- come quick ! ” 

 “ rubbage ! i do n't believe it ! ” 

 but she fled upstairs , nevertheless , with sid and mary at her heels . 
 and her face grew white , too , and her lip trembled . when she reached the 
 bedside she gasped out : 

 “ you , tom ! tom , what 's the matter with you ? ” 

 “ oh , auntie , i'm-- ” 

 “ what 's the matter with you -- what is the matter with you , child ? ” 

 “ oh , auntie , my sore toe 's mortified ! ” 

 the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little , then cried a 
 little , then did both together . this restored her and she said : 

 “ tom , what a turn you did give me . now you shut up that nonsense and 
 climb out of this . ” 

 the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe . the boy felt a 
 little foolish , and he said : 

 “ aunt polly , it _ seemed _ mortified , and it hurt so i never minded my 
 tooth at all . ” 

 “ your tooth , indeed ! what 's the matter with your tooth ? ” 

 “ one of them 's loose , and it aches perfectly awful . ” 

 “ there , there , now , do n't begin that groaning again . open your mouth . 
 well -- your tooth _ is _ loose , but you 're not going to die about that . 
 mary , get me a silk thread , and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen . ” 

 tom said : 

 “ oh , please , auntie , do n't pull it out . it do n't hurt any more . i wish 
 i may never stir if it does . please do n't , auntie . i do n't want to stay 
 home from school . ” 

 “ oh , you do n't , do n't you ? so all this row was because you thought you 'd 
 get to stay home from school and go a - fishing ? tom , tom , i love you so , 
 and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your 
 outrageousness . ” by this time the dental instruments were ready . the old 
 lady made one end of the silk thread fast to tom 's tooth with a loop 
 and tied the other to the bedpost . then she seized the chunk of fire and 
 suddenly thrust it almost into the boy 's face . the tooth hung dangling 
 by the bedpost , now . 

 but all trials bring their compensations . as tom wended to school after 
 breakfast , he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his 
 upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable 
 way . he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition ; 
 and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and 
 homage up to this time , now found himself suddenly without an adherent , 
 and shorn of his glory . his heart was heavy , and he said with a disdain 
 which he did not feel that it was n't anything to spit like tom sawyer ; 
 but another boy said , “ sour grapes ! ” and he wandered away a dismantled 
 hero . 

 shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village , huckleberry 
 finn , son of the town drunkard . huckleberry was cordially hated and 
 dreaded by all the mothers of the town , because he was idle and lawless 
 and vulgar and bad -- and because all their children admired him so , and 
 delighted in his forbidden society , and wished they dared to be like 
 him . tom was like the rest of the respectable boys , in that he envied 
 huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition , and was under strict orders 
 not to play with him . so he played with him every time he got a chance . 
 huckleberry was always dressed in the cast - off clothes of full - grown 
 men , and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags . his hat 
 was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim ; his coat , 
 when he wore one , hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons 
 far down the back ; but one suspender supported his trousers ; the seat of 
 the trousers bagged low and contained nothing , the fringed legs dragged 
 in the dirt when not rolled up . 

 huckleberry came and went , at his own free will . he slept on doorsteps 
 in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet ; he did not have to go to 
 school or to church , or call any being master or obey anybody ; he could 
 go fishing or swimming when and where he chose , and stay as long as it 
 suited him ; nobody forbade him to fight ; he could sit up as late as he 
 pleased ; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring 
 and the last to resume leather in the fall ; he never had to wash , nor 
 put on clean clothes ; he could swear wonderfully . in a word , everything 
 that goes to make life precious that boy had . so thought every harassed , 
 hampered , respectable boy in st. petersburg . 

 tom hailed the romantic outcast : 

 “ hello , huckleberry ! ” 

 “ hello yourself , and see how you like it . ” 

 “ what 's that you got ? ” 

 “ dead cat . ” 

 “ lemme see him , huck . my , he 's pretty stiff . where 'd you get him ? ” 

 “ bought him off'n a boy . ” 

 “ what did you give ? ” 

 “ i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter - house . ” 

 “ where 'd you get the blue ticket ? ” 

 “ bought it off'n ben rogers two weeks ago for a hoop - stick . ” 

 “ say -- what is dead cats good for , huck ? ” 

 “ good for ? cure warts with . ” 

 “ no ! is that so ? i know something that 's better . ” 

 “ i bet you do n't . what is it ? ” 

 “ why , spunk - water . ” 

 “ spunk - water ! i would n't give a dern for spunk - water . ” 

 “ you would n't , would n't you ? d'you ever try it ? ” 

 “ no , i hain't . but bob tanner did . ” 

 “ who told you so ! ” 

 “ why , he told jeff thatcher , and jeff told johnny baker , and johnny 
 told jim hollis , and jim told ben rogers , and ben told a nigger , and the 
 nigger told me . there now ! ” 

 “ well , what of it ? they 'll all lie . leastways all but the nigger . i 
 do n't know _ him_. but i never see a nigger that _ would n't _ lie . shucks ! 
 now you tell me how bob tanner done it , huck . ” 

 “ why , he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain - water 
 was . ” 

 “ in the daytime ? ” 

 “ certainly . ” 

 “ with his face to the stump ? ” 

 “ yes . least i reckon so . ” 

 “ did he say anything ? ” 

 “ i do n't reckon he did . i do n't know . ” 

 “ aha ! talk about trying to cure warts with spunk - water such a blame fool 
 way as that ! why , that ai n't a - going to do any good . you got to go all 
 by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there 's a 
 spunk - water stump , and just as it 's midnight you back up against the stump 
 and jam your hand in and say : 

 ' barley - corn , barley - corn , injun - meal shorts , spunk - water , spunk - water , 
 swaller these warts , ' 

 and then walk away quick , eleven steps , with your eyes shut , and then 
 turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody . 
 because if you speak the charm 's busted . ” 

 “ well , that sounds like a good way ; but that ai n't the way bob tanner 
 done . ” 

 “ no , sir , you can bet he did n't , becuz he 's the wartiest boy in this 
 town ; and he would n't have a wart on him if he 'd knowed how to work 
 spunk - water . i 've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way , 
 huck . i play with frogs so much that i 've always got considerable many 
 warts . sometimes i take 'em off with a bean . ” 

 “ yes , bean 's good . i 've done that . ” 

 “ have you ? what 's your way ? ” 

 “ you take and split the bean , and cut the wart so as to get some blood , 
 and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig 
 a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the 
 moon , and then you burn up the rest of the bean . you see that piece 
 that 's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing , trying to 
 fetch the other piece to it , and so that helps the blood to draw the 
 wart , and pretty soon off she comes . ” 

 “ yes , that 's it , huck -- that 's it ; though when you 're burying it if you 
 say ' down bean ; off wart ; come no more to bother me ! ' it 's better . 
 that 's the way joe harper does , and he 's been nearly to coonville and 
 most everywheres . but say -- how do you cure 'em with dead cats ? ” 

 “ why , you take your cat and go and get in the grave - yard ' long about 
 midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried ; and when it 's 
 midnight a devil will come , or maybe two or three , but you ca n't see 
 'em , you can only hear something like the wind , or maybe hear 'em talk ; 
 and when they 're taking that feller away , you heave your cat after 'em 
 and say , ' devil follow corpse , cat follow devil , warts follow cat , i 'm 
 done with ye ! ' that 'll fetch _ any _ wart . ” 

 “ sounds right . d'you ever try it , huck ? ” 

 “ no , but old mother hopkins told me . ” 

 “ well , i reckon it 's so , then . becuz they say she 's a witch . ” 

 “ say ! why , tom , i _ know _ she is . she witched pap . pap says so his own 
 self . he come along one day , and he see she was a - witching him , so he 
 took up a rock , and if she had n't dodged , he 'd a got her . well , that 
 very night he rolled off'n a shed wher ' he was a layin drunk , and broke 
 his arm . ” 

 “ why , that 's awful . how did he know she was a - witching him ? ” 

 “ lord , pap can tell , easy . pap says when they keep looking at you right 
 stiddy , they 're a - witching you . specially if they mumble . becuz when 
 they mumble they 're saying the lord 's prayer backards . ” 

 “ say , hucky , when you going to try the cat ? ” 

 “ to - night . i reckon they 'll come after old hoss williams to - night . ” 

 “ but they buried him saturday . did n't they get him saturday night ? ” 

 “ why , how you talk ! how could their charms work till midnight ?-- and 
 _ then _ it 's sunday . devils do n't slosh around much of a sunday , i do n't 
 reckon . ” 

 “ i never thought of that . that 's so . lemme go with you ? ” 

 “ of course -- if you ai n't afeard . ” 

 “ afeard ! ' tain't likely . will you meow ? ” 

 “ yes -- and you meow back , if you get a chance . last time , you kep ' me 
 a - meowing around till old hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 
 ' dern that cat ! ' and so i hove a brick through his window -- but do n't you 
 tell . ” 

 “ i wo n't . i could n't meow that night , becuz auntie was watching me , but 
 i 'll meow this time . say -- what 's that ? ” 

 “ nothing but a tick . ” 

 “ where 'd you get him ? ” 

 “ out in the woods . ” 

 “ what 'll you take for him ? ” 

 “ i do n't know . i do n't want to sell him . ” 

 “ all right . it 's a mighty small tick , anyway . ” 

 “ oh , anybody can run a tick down that do n't belong to them . i 'm 
 satisfied with it . it 's a good enough tick for me . ” 

 “ sho , there 's ticks a plenty . i could have a thousand of 'em if i wanted 
 to . ” 

 “ well , why do n't you ? becuz you know mighty well you ca n't . this is a 
 pretty early tick , i reckon . it 's the first one i 've seen this year . ” 

 “ say , huck -- i'll give you my tooth for him . ” 

 “ less see it . ” 

 tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it . huckleberry viewed 
 it wistfully . the temptation was very strong . at last he said : 

 “ is it genuwyne ? ” 

 tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy . 

 “ well , all right , ” said huckleberry , “ it 's a trade . ” 

 tom enclosed the tick in the percussion - cap box that had lately been the 
 pinchbug 's prison , and the boys separated , each feeling wealthier than 
 before . 

 when tom reached the little isolated frame school - house , he strode in 
 briskly , with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed . he 
 hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business - like 
 alacrity . the master , throned on high in his great splint - bottom 
 arm - chair , was dozing , lulled by the drowsy hum of study . the 
 interruption roused him . 

 “ thomas sawyer ! ” 

 tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full , it meant trouble . 

 “ sir ! ” 

 “ come up here . now , sir , why are you late again , as usual ? ” 

 tom was about to take refuge in a lie , when he saw two long tails of 
 yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric 
 sympathy of love ; and by that form was _ the only vacant place _ on the 
 girls ' side of the school - house . he instantly said : 

 “ _ i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn ! _ ” 

 the master 's pulse stood still , and he stared helplessly . the buzz of 
 study ceased . the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his 
 mind . the master said : 

 “ you -- you did what ? ” 

 “ stopped to talk with huckleberry finn . ” 

 there was no mistaking the words . 

 “ thomas sawyer , this is the most astounding confession i have ever 
 listened to . no mere ferule will answer for this offence . take off your 
 jacket . ” 

 the master 's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches 
 notably diminished . then the order followed : 

 “ now , sir , go and sit with the girls ! and let this be a warning to you . ” 

 the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy , but 
 in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe 
 of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good 
 fortune . he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched 
 herself away from him with a toss of her head . nudges and winks and 
 whispers traversed the room , but tom sat still , with his arms upon the 
 long , low desk before him , and seemed to study his book . 

 by and by attention ceased from him , and the accustomed school murmur 
 rose upon the dull air once more . presently the boy began to steal 
 furtive glances at the girl . she observed it , “ made a mouth ” at him 
 and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute . when she 
 cautiously faced around again , a peach lay before her . she thrust it 
 away . tom gently put it back . she thrust it away again , but with less 
 animosity . tom patiently returned it to its place . then she let it 
 remain . tom scrawled on his slate , “ please take it -- i got more . ” the 
 girl glanced at the words , but made no sign . now the boy began to draw 
 something on the slate , hiding his work with his left hand . for a time 
 the girl refused to notice ; but her human curiosity presently began 
 to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs . the boy worked on , 
 apparently unconscious . the girl made a sort of non - committal attempt 
 to see , but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it . at last she 
 gave in and hesitatingly whispered : 

 “ let me see it . ” 

 tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends 
 to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney . then the girl 's 
 interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything 
 else . when it was finished , she gazed a moment , then whispered : 

 “ it 's nice -- make a man . ” 

 the artist erected a man in the front yard , that resembled a derrick . he 
 could have stepped over the house ; but the girl was not hypercritical ; 
 she was satisfied with the monster , and whispered : 

 “ it 's a beautiful man -- now make me coming along . ” 

 tom drew an hour - glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed 
 the spreading fingers with a portentous fan . the girl said : 

 “ it 's ever so nice -- i wish i could draw . ” 

 “ it 's easy , ” whispered tom , “ i 'll learn you . ” 

 “ oh , will you ? when ? ” 

 “ at noon . do you go home to dinner ? ” 

 “ i 'll stay if you will . ” 

 “ good -- that 's a whack . what 's your name ? ” 

 “ becky thatcher . what 's yours ? oh , i know . it 's thomas sawyer . ” 

 “ that 's the name they lick me by . i 'm tom when i 'm good . you call me 
 tom , will you ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 now tom began to scrawl something on the slate , hiding the words from 
 the girl . but she was not backward this time . she begged to see . tom 
 said : 

 “ oh , it ai n't anything . ” 

 “ yes it is . ” 

 “ no it ai n't . you do n't want to see . ” 

 “ yes i do , indeed i do . please let me . ” 

 “ you 'll tell . ” 

 “ no i won't -- deed and deed and double deed wo n't . ” 

 “ you wo n't tell anybody at all ? ever , as long as you live ? ” 

 “ no , i wo n't ever tell _ any_body . now let me . ” 

 “ oh , _ you _ do n't want to see ! ” 

 “ now that you treat me so , i _ will _ see . ” and she put her small hand 
 upon his and a little scuffle ensued , tom pretending to resist in 
 earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were 
 revealed : “ _ i love you_. ” 

 “ oh , you bad thing ! ” and she hit his hand a smart rap , but reddened and 
 looked pleased , nevertheless . 

 just at this juncture the boy felt a slow , fateful grip closing on his 
 ear , and a steady lifting impulse . in that wise he was borne across the 
 house and deposited in his own seat , under a peppering fire of giggles 
 from the whole school . then the master stood over him during a few awful 
 moments , and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word . but 
 although tom 's ear tingled , his heart was jubilant . 

 as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study , but 
 the turmoil within him was too great . in turn he took his place in the 
 reading class and made a botch of it ; then in the geography class and 
 turned lakes into mountains , mountains into rivers , and rivers into 
 continents , till chaos was come again ; then in the spelling class , and 
 got “ turned down , ” by a succession of mere baby words , till he brought 
 up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with 
 ostentation for months . 




 chapter vii 

 the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book , the more his ideas 
 wandered . so at last , with a sigh and a yawn , he gave it up . it seemed 
 to him that the noon recess would never come . the air was utterly dead . 
 there was not a breath stirring . it was the sleepiest of sleepy days . 
 the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed 
 the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees . away off in the 
 flaming sunshine , cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a 
 shimmering veil of heat , tinted with the purple of distance ; a few birds 
 floated on lazy wing high in the air ; no other living thing was visible 
 but some cows , and they were asleep . tom 's heart ached to be free , or 
 else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time . 
 his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of 
 gratitude that was prayer , though he did not know it . then furtively 
 the percussion - cap box came out . he released the tick and put him on 
 the long flat desk . the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that 
 amounted to prayer , too , at this moment , but it was premature : for when 
 he started thankfully to travel off , tom turned him aside with a pin and 
 made him take a new direction . 

 tom 's bosom friend sat next him , suffering just as tom had been , and 
 now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in 
 an instant . this bosom friend was joe harper . the two boys were sworn 
 friends all the week , and embattled enemies on saturdays . joe took a 
 pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner . 
 the sport grew in interest momently . soon tom said that they were 
 interfering with each other , and neither getting the fullest benefit 
 of the tick . so he put joe 's slate on the desk and drew a line down the 
 middle of it from top to bottom . 

 “ now , ” said he , “ as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and 
 i 'll let him alone ; but if you let him get away and get on my side , 
 you 're to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over . ” 

 “ all right , go ahead ; start him up . ” 

 the tick escaped from tom , presently , and crossed the equator . joe 
 harassed him awhile , and then he got away and crossed back again . this 
 change of base occurred often . while one boy was worrying the tick with 
 absorbing interest , the other would look on with interest as strong , the 
 two heads bowed together over the slate , and the two souls dead to all 
 things else . at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe . the 
 tick tried this , that , and the other course , and got as excited and as 
 anxious as the boys themselves , but time and again just as he would 
 have victory in his very grasp , so to speak , and tom 's fingers would 
 be twitching to begin , joe 's pin would deftly head him off , and keep 
 possession . at last tom could stand it no longer . the temptation was too 
 strong . so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin . joe was angry in 
 a moment . said he : 

 “ tom , you let him alone . ” 

 “ i only just want to stir him up a little , joe . ” 

 “ no , sir , it ai n't fair ; you just let him alone . ” 

 “ blame it , i ai n't going to stir him much . ” 

 “ let him alone , i tell you . ” 

 “ i wo n't ! ” 

 “ you shall -- he 's on my side of the line . ” 

 “ look here , joe harper , whose is that tick ? ” 

 “ i do n't care whose tick he is -- he 's on my side of the line , and you 
 sha'n't touch him . ” 

 “ well , i 'll just bet i will , though . he 's my tick and i 'll do what i 
 blame please with him , or die ! ” 

 a tremendous whack came down on tom 's shoulders , and its duplicate on 
 joe 's ; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from 
 the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it . the boys had been 
 too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile 
 before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them . 
 he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed 
 his bit of variety to it . 

 when school broke up at noon , tom flew to becky thatcher , and whispered 
 in her ear : 

 “ put on your bonnet and let on you 're going home ; and when you get to 
 the corner , give the rest of 'em the slip , and turn down through the 
 lane and come back . i 'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same 
 way . ” 

 so the one went off with one group of scholars , and the other with 
 another . in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane , and 
 when they reached the school they had it all to themselves . then they 
 sat together , with a slate before them , and tom gave becky the pencil 
 and held her hand in his , guiding it , and so created another surprising 
 house . when the interest in art began to wane , the two fell to talking . 
 tom was swimming in bliss . he said : 

 “ do you love rats ? ” 

 “ no ! i hate them ! ” 

 “ well , i do , too--_live _ ones . but i mean dead ones , to swing round your 
 head with a string . ” 

 “ no , i do n't care for rats much , anyway . what i like is chewing - gum . ” 

 “ oh , i should say so ! i wish i had some now . ” 

 “ do you ? i 've got some . i 'll let you chew it awhile , but you must give 
 it back to me . ” 

 that was agreeable , so they chewed it turn about , and dangled their legs 
 against the bench in excess of contentment . 

 “ was you ever at a circus ? ” said tom . 

 “ yes , and my pa 's going to take me again some time , if i 'm good . ” 

 “ i been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times . church ai n't 
 shucks to a circus . there 's things going on at a circus all the time . 
 i 'm going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up . ” 

 “ oh , are you ! that will be nice . they 're so lovely , all spotted up . ” 

 “ yes , that 's so . and they get slathers of money -- most a dollar a day , ben 
 rogers says . say , becky , was you ever engaged ? ” 

 “ what 's that ? ” 

 “ why , engaged to be married . ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ would you like to ? ” 

 “ i reckon so . i do n't know . what is it like ? ” 

 “ like ? why it ai n't like anything . you only just tell a boy you wo n't 
 ever have anybody but him , ever ever ever , and then you kiss and that 's 
 all . anybody can do it . ” 

 “ kiss ? what do you kiss for ? ” 

 “ why , that , you know , is to -- well , they always do that . ” 

 “ everybody ? ” 

 “ why , yes , everybody that 's in love with each other . do you remember 
 what i wrote on the slate ? ” 

 “ ye -- yes . ” 

 “ what was it ? ” 

 “ i sha'n't tell you . ” 

 “ shall i tell _ you _ ? ” 

 “ ye -- yes -- but some other time . ” 

 “ no , now . ” 

 “ no , not now -- to - morrow . ” 

 “ oh , no , _ now_. please , becky -- i'll whisper it , i 'll whisper it ever so 
 easy . ” 

 becky hesitating , tom took silence for consent , and passed his arm about 
 her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly , with his mouth close to 
 her ear . and then he added : 

 “ now you whisper it to me -- just the same . ” 

 she resisted , for a while , and then said : 

 “ you turn your face away so you ca n't see , and then i will . but you 
 must n't ever tell anybody--_will _ you , tom ? now you wo n't , _ will _ you ? ” 

 “ no , indeed , indeed i wo n't . now , becky . ” 

 he turned his face away . she bent timidly around till her breath stirred 
 his curls and whispered , “ i -- love -- you ! ” 

 then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches , 
 with tom after her , and took refuge in a corner at last , with her little 
 white apron to her face . tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded : 

 “ now , becky , it 's all done -- all over but the kiss . do n't you be afraid 
 of that -- it ai n't anything at all . please , becky . ” and he tugged at her 
 apron and the hands . 

 by and by she gave up , and let her hands drop ; her face , all glowing 
 with the struggle , came up and submitted . tom kissed the red lips and 
 said : 

 “ now it 's all done , becky . and always after this , you know , you ai n't 
 ever to love anybody but me , and you ai n't ever to marry anybody but me , 
 ever never and forever . will you ? ” 

 “ no , i 'll never love anybody but you , tom , and i 'll never marry anybody 
 but you -- and you ai n't to ever marry anybody but me , either . ” 

 “ certainly . of course . that 's _ part _ of it . and always coming to school 
 or when we 're going home , you 're to walk with me , when there ai n't 
 anybody looking -- and you choose me and i choose you at parties , because 
 that 's the way you do when you 're engaged . ” 

 “ it 's so nice . i never heard of it before . ” 

 “ oh , it 's ever so gay ! why , me and amy lawrence-- ” 

 the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped , confused . 

 “ oh , tom ! then i ai n't the first you 've ever been engaged to ! ” 

 the child began to cry . tom said : 

 “ oh , do n't cry , becky , i do n't care for her any more . ” 

 “ yes , you do , tom -- you know you do . ” 

 tom tried to put his arm about her neck , but she pushed him away and 
 turned her face to the wall , and went on crying . tom tried again , with 
 soothing words in his mouth , and was repulsed again . then his pride was 
 up , and he strode away and went outside . he stood about , restless and 
 uneasy , for a while , glancing at the door , every now and then , hoping 
 she would repent and come to find him . but she did not . then he began 
 to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong . it was a hard struggle 
 with him to make new advances , now , but he nerved himself to it and 
 entered . she was still standing back there in the corner , sobbing , with 
 her face to the wall . tom 's heart smote him . he went to her and stood a 
 moment , not knowing exactly how to proceed . then he said hesitatingly : 

 “ becky , i -- i do n't care for anybody but you . ” 

 no reply -- but sobs . 

 “ becky”--pleadingly . “ becky , wo n't you say something ? ” 

 more sobs . 

 tom got out his chiefest jewel , a brass knob from the top of an andiron , 
 and passed it around her so that she could see it , and said : 

 “ please , becky , wo n't you take it ? ” 

 she struck it to the floor . then tom marched out of the house and over 
 the hills and far away , to return to school no more that day . presently 
 becky began to suspect . she ran to the door ; he was not in sight ; she 
 flew around to the play - yard ; he was not there . then she called : 

 “ tom ! come back , tom ! ” 

 she listened intently , but there was no answer . she had no companions 
 but silence and loneliness . so she sat down to cry again and upbraid 
 herself ; and by this time the scholars began to gather again , and she 
 had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross 
 of a long , dreary , aching afternoon , with none among the strangers about 
 her to exchange sorrows with . 




 chapter viii 

 tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the 
 track of returning scholars , and then fell into a moody jog . he crossed 
 a small “ branch ” two or three times , because of a prevailing juvenile 
 superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit . half an hour later 
 he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff 
 hill , and the school - house was hardly distinguishable away off in the 
 valley behind him . he entered a dense wood , picked his pathless way to 
 the centre of it , and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak . 
 there was not even a zephyr stirring ; the dead noonday heat had even 
 stilled the songs of the birds ; nature lay in a trance that was broken 
 by no sound but the occasional far - off hammering of a wood - pecker , and 
 this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the 
 more profound . the boy 's soul was steeped in melancholy ; his feelings 
 were in happy accord with his surroundings . he sat long with his elbows 
 on his knees and his chin in his hands , meditating . it seemed to him 
 that life was but a trouble , at best , and he more than half envied jimmy 
 hodges , so lately released ; it must be very peaceful , he thought , to lie 
 and slumber and dream forever and ever , with the wind whispering through 
 the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave , and 
 nothing to bother and grieve about , ever any more . if he only had a 
 clean sunday - school record he could be willing to go , and be done with 
 it all . now as to this girl . what had he done ? nothing . he had meant 
 the best in the world , and been treated like a dog -- like a very dog . she 
 would be sorry some day -- maybe when it was too late . ah , if he could only 
 die _ temporarily _ ! 

 but the elastic heart of youth can not be compressed into one constrained 
 shape long at a time . tom presently began to drift insensibly back into 
 the concerns of this life again . what if he turned his back , now , and 
 disappeared mysteriously ? what if he went away -- ever so far away , into 
 unknown countries beyond the seas -- and never came back any more ! how 
 would she feel then ! the idea of being a clown recurred to him now , only 
 to fill him with disgust . for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights 
 were an offense , when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was 
 exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic . no , he would be 
 a soldier , and return after long years , all war - worn and illustrious . 
 no -- better still , he would join the indians , and hunt buffaloes and go on 
 the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the 
 far west , and away in the future come back a great chief , bristling with 
 feathers , hideous with paint , and prance into sunday - school , some drowsy 
 summer morning , with a blood - curdling war - whoop , and sear the eyeballs 
 of all his companions with unappeasable envy . but no , there was 
 something gaudier even than this . he would be a pirate ! that was it ! 
 _ now _ his future lay plain before him , and glowing with unimaginable 
 splendor . how his name would fill the world , and make people shudder ! 
 how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas , in his long , low , 
 black - hulled racer , the spirit of the storm , with his grisly flag flying 
 at the fore ! and at the zenith of his fame , how he would suddenly appear 
 at the old village and stalk into church , brown and weather - beaten , in 
 his black velvet doublet and trunks , his great jack - boots , his crimson 
 sash , his belt bristling with horse - pistols , his crime - rusted cutlass 
 at his side , his slouch hat with waving plumes , his black flag unfurled , 
 with the skull and crossbones on it , and hear with swelling ecstasy 
 the whisperings , “ it 's tom sawyer the pirate!--the black avenger of the 
 spanish main ! ” 

 yes , it was settled ; his career was determined . he would run away from 
 home and enter upon it . he would start the very next morning . therefore 
 he must now begin to get ready . he would collect his resources together . 
 he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of 
 it with his barlow knife . he soon struck wood that sounded hollow . he 
 put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively : 

 “ what has n't come here , come ! what 's here , stay here ! ” 

 then he scraped away the dirt , and exposed a pine shingle . he took it 
 up and disclosed a shapely little treasure - house whose bottom and sides 
 were of shingles . in it lay a marble . tom 's astonishment was bound - less ! 
 he scratched his head with a perplexed air , and said : 

 “ well , that beats anything ! ” 

 then he tossed the marble away pettishly , and stood cogitating . the 
 truth was , that a superstition of his had failed , here , which he and 
 all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible . if you buried 
 a marble with certain necessary incantations , and left it alone a 
 fortnight , and then opened the place with the incantation he had just 
 used , you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered 
 themselves together there , meantime , no matter how widely they had been 
 separated . but now , this thing had actually and unquestionably failed . 
 tom 's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations . he had 
 many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing 
 before . it did not occur to him that he had tried it several times 
 before , himself , but could never find the hiding - places afterward . he 
 puzzled over the matter some time , and finally decided that some witch 
 had interfered and broken the charm . he thought he would satisfy himself 
 on that point ; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot 
 with a little funnel - shaped depression in it . he laid himself down and 
 put his mouth close to this depression and called-- 

 “ doodle - bug , doodle - bug , tell me what i want to know ! doodle - bug , 
 doodle - bug , tell me what i want to know ! ” 

 the sand began to work , and presently a small black bug appeared for a 
 second and then darted under again in a fright . 

 “ he dasn't tell ! so it _ was _ a witch that done it . i just knowed it . ” 

 he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches , so he 
 gave up discouraged . but it occurred to him that he might as well have 
 the marble he had just thrown away , and therefore he went and made a 
 patient search for it . but he could not find it . now he went back to his 
 treasure - house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing 
 when he tossed the marble away ; then he took another marble from his 
 pocket and tossed it in the same way , saying : 

 “ brother , go find your brother ! ” 

 he watched where it stopped , and went there and looked . but it must 
 have fallen short or gone too far ; so he tried twice more . the last 
 repetition was successful . the two marbles lay within a foot of each 
 other . 

 just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green 
 aisles of the forest . tom flung off his jacket and trousers , turned 
 a suspender into a belt , raked away some brush behind the rotten log , 
 disclosing a rude bow and arrow , a lath sword and a tin trumpet , and 
 in a moment had seized these things and bounded away , barelegged , 
 with fluttering shirt . he presently halted under a great elm , blew an 
 answering blast , and then began to tiptoe and look warily out , this way 
 and that . he said cautiously -- to an imaginary company : 

 “ hold , my merry men ! keep hid till i blow . ” 

 now appeared joe harper , as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom . 
 tom called : 

 “ hold ! who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass ? ” 

 “ guy of guisborne wants no man 's pass . who art thou that -- that-- ” 

 “ dares to hold such language , ” said tom , prompting -- for they talked “ by 
 the book , ” from memory . 

 “ who art thou that dares to hold such language ? ” 

 “ i , indeed ! i am robin hood , as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know . ” 

 “ then art thou indeed that famous outlaw ? right gladly will i dispute 
 with thee the passes of the merry wood . have at thee ! ” 

 they took their lath swords , dumped their other traps on the ground , 
 struck a fencing attitude , foot to foot , and began a grave , careful 
 combat , “ two up and two down . ” presently tom said : 

 “ now , if you 've got the hang , go it lively ! ” 

 so they “ went it lively , ” panting and perspiring with the work . by and 
 by tom shouted : 

 “ fall ! fall ! why do n't you fall ? ” 

 “ i sha'n't ! why do n't you fall yourself ? you 're getting the worst of 
 it . ” 

 “ why , that ai n't anything . i ca n't fall ; that ai n't the way it is in the 
 book . the book says , ' then with one back - handed stroke he slew poor guy 
 of guisborne . ' you 're to turn around and let me hit you in the back . ” 

 there was no getting around the authorities , so joe turned , received the 
 whack and fell . 

 “ now , ” said joe , getting up , “ you got to let me kill _ you_. that 's 
 fair . ” 

 “ why , i ca n't do that , it ai n't in the book . ” 

 “ well , it 's blamed mean -- that 's all . ” 

 “ well , say , joe , you can be friar tuck or much the miller 's son , and lam 
 me with a quarter - staff ; or i 'll be the sheriff of nottingham and you be 
 robin hood a little while and kill me . ” 

 this was satisfactory , and so these adventures were carried out . then 
 tom became robin hood again , and was allowed by the treacherous nun to 
 bleed his strength away through his neglected wound . and at last joe , 
 representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws , dragged him sadly forth , 
 gave his bow into his feeble hands , and tom said , “ where this arrow 
 falls , there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree . ” then he 
 shot the arrow and fell back and would have died , but he lit on a nettle 
 and sprang up too gaily for a corpse . 

 the boys dressed themselves , hid their accoutrements , and went off 
 grieving that there were no outlaws any more , and wondering what modern 
 civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss . 
 they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than 
 president of the united states forever . 




 chapter ix 

 at half - past nine , that night , tom and sid were sent to bed , as usual . 
 they said their prayers , and sid was soon asleep . tom lay awake and 
 waited , in restless impatience . when it seemed to him that it must be 
 nearly daylight , he heard the clock strike ten ! this was despair . he 
 would have tossed and fidgeted , as his nerves demanded , but he was 
 afraid he might wake sid . so he lay still , and stared up into the dark . 
 everything was dismally still . by and by , out of the stillness , little , 
 scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves . the ticking 
 of the clock began to bring itself into notice . old beams began to crack 
 mysteriously . the stairs creaked faintly . evidently spirits were abroad . 
 a measured , muffled snore issued from aunt polly 's chamber . and now the 
 tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate , 
 began . next the ghastly ticking of a death - watch in the wall at the 
 bed 's head made tom shudder -- it meant that somebody 's days were numbered . 
 then the howl of a far - off dog rose on the night air , and was answered 
 by a fainter howl from a remoter distance . tom was in an agony . at last 
 he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun ; he began to 
 doze , in spite of himself ; the clock chimed eleven , but he did not hear 
 it . and then there came , mingling with his half - formed dreams , a most 
 melancholy caterwauling . the raising of a neighboring window disturbed 
 him . a cry of “ scat ! you devil ! ” and the crash of an empty bottle 
 against the back of his aunt 's woodshed brought him wide awake , and a 
 single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping 
 along the roof of the “ ell ” on all fours . he “ meow'd ” with caution once 
 or twice , as he went ; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence 
 to the ground . huckleberry finn was there , with his dead cat . the boys 
 moved off and disappeared in the gloom . at the end of half an hour they 
 were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard . 

 it was a graveyard of the old - fashioned western kind . it was on a hill , 
 about a mile and a half from the village . it had a crazy board fence 
 around it , which leaned inward in places , and outward the rest of the 
 time , but stood upright nowhere . grass and weeds grew rank over the 
 whole cemetery . all the old graves were sunken in , there was not a 
 tombstone on the place ; round - topped , worm - eaten boards staggered over 
 the graves , leaning for support and finding none . “ sacred to the memory 
 of ” so - and - so had been painted on them once , but it could no longer have 
 been read , on the most of them , now , even if there had been light . 

 a faint wind moaned through the trees , and tom feared it might be the 
 spirits of the dead , complaining at being disturbed . the boys talked 
 little , and only under their breath , for the time and the place and the 
 pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits . they found the 
 sharp new heap they were seeking , and ensconced themselves within the 
 protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of 
 the grave . 

 then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time . the hooting of 
 a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness . tom 's 
 reflections grew oppressive . he must force some talk . so he said in a 
 whisper : 

 “ hucky , do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here ? ” 

 huckleberry whispered : 

 “ i wisht i knowed . it 's awful solemn like , _ ai n't _ it ? ” 

 “ i bet it is . ” 

 there was a considerable pause , while the boys canvassed this matter 
 inwardly . then tom whispered : 

 “ say , hucky -- do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking ? ” 

 “ o ' course he does . least his sperrit does . ” 

 tom , after a pause : 

 “ i wish i 'd said mister williams . but i never meant any harm . everybody 
 calls him hoss . ” 

 “ a body ca n't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these - yer dead 
 people , tom . ” 

 this was a damper , and conversation died again . 

 presently tom seized his comrade 's arm and said : 

 “ sh ! ” 

 “ what is it , tom ? ” and the two clung together with beating hearts . 

 “ sh ! there ' tis again ! did n't you hear it ? ” 

 “ i-- ” 

 “ there ! now you hear it . ” 

 “ lord , tom , they 're coming ! they 're coming , sure . what 'll we do ? ” 

 “ i dono . think they 'll see us ? ” 

 “ oh , tom , they can see in the dark , same as cats . i wisht i had n't 
 come . ” 

 “ oh , do n't be afeard . i do n't believe they 'll bother us . we ai n't doing 
 any harm . if we keep perfectly still , maybe they wo n't notice us at 
 all . ” 

 “ i 'll try to , tom , but , lord , i 'm all of a shiver . ” 

 “ listen ! ” 

 the boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed . a muffled 
 sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard . 

 “ look ! see there ! ” whispered tom . “ what is it ? ” 

 “ it 's devil - fire . oh , tom , this is awful . ” 

 some vague figures approached through the gloom , swinging an 
 old - fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable 
 little spangles of light . presently huckleberry whispered with a 
 shudder : 

 “ it 's the devils sure enough . three of 'em ! lordy , tom , we 're goners ! 
 can you pray ? ” 

 “ i 'll try , but do n't you be afeard . they ai n't going to hurt us . ' now i 
 lay me down to sleep , i-- ' ” 

 “ sh ! ” 

 “ what is it , huck ? ” 

 “ they 're _ humans _ ! one of 'em is , anyway . one of 'em 's old muff potter 's 
 voice . ” 

 “ no--'tain't so , is it ? ” 

 “ i bet i know it . do n't you stir nor budge . he ai n't sharp enough to 
 notice us . drunk , the same as usual , likely -- blamed old rip ! ” 

 “ all right , i 'll keep still . now they 're stuck . ca n't find it . here they 
 come again . now they 're hot . cold again . hot again . red hot ! they 're 
 p'inted right , this time . say , huck , i know another o ' them voices ; it 's 
 injun joe . ” 

 “ that 's so -- that murderin ' half - breed ! i 'd druther they was devils a dern 
 sight . what kin they be up to ? ” 

 the whisper died wholly out , now , for the three men had reached the 
 grave and stood within a few feet of the boys ' hiding - place . 

 “ here it is , ” said the third voice ; and the owner of it held the lantern 
 up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson . 

 potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple 
 of shovels on it . they cast down their load and began to open the grave . 
 the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat 
 down with his back against one of the elm trees . he was so close the 
 boys could have touched him . 

 “ hurry , men ! ” he said , in a low voice ; “ the moon might come out at any 
 moment . ” 

 they growled a response and went on digging . for some time there was no 
 noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of 
 mould and gravel . it was very monotonous . finally a spade struck upon 
 the coffin with a dull woody accent , and within another minute or two 
 the men had hoisted it out on the ground . they pried off the lid with 
 their shovels , got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground . the 
 moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face . 
 the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it , covered with a 
 blanket , and bound to its place with the rope . potter took out a large 
 spring - knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said : 

 “ now the cussed thing 's ready , sawbones , and you 'll just out with 
 another five , or here she stays . ” 

 “ that 's the talk ! ” said injun joe . 

 “ look here , what does this mean ? ” said the doctor . “ you required your 
 pay in advance , and i 've paid you . ” 

 “ yes , and you done more than that , ” said injun joe , approaching the 
 doctor , who was now standing . “ five years ago you drove me away from 
 your father 's kitchen one night , when i come to ask for something to 
 eat , and you said i warn't there for any good ; and when i swore i 'd get 
 even with you if it took a hundred years , your father had me jailed for 
 a vagrant . did you think i 'd forget ? the injun blood ai n't in me for 
 nothing . and now i 've _ got _ you , and you got to _ settle _ , you know ! ” 

 he was threatening the doctor , with his fist in his face , by this time . 
 the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground . 
 potter dropped his knife , and exclaimed : 

 “ here , now , do n't you hit my pard ! ” and the next moment he had grappled 
 with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main , 
 trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels . injun joe 
 sprang to his feet , his eyes flaming with passion , snatched up potter 's 
 knife , and went creeping , catlike and stooping , round and round about 
 the combatants , seeking an opportunity . all at once the doctor flung 
 himself free , seized the heavy headboard of williams ' grave and felled 
 potter to the earth with it -- and in the same instant the half - breed saw 
 his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man 's breast . he 
 reeled and fell partly upon potter , flooding him with his blood , and in 
 the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the 
 two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark . 

 presently , when the moon emerged again , injun joe was standing over the 
 two forms , contemplating them . the doctor murmured inarticulately , gave 
 a long gasp or two and was still . the half - breed muttered : 

 “ _ that _ score is settled -- damn you . ” 

 then he robbed the body . after which he put the fatal knife in potter 's 
 open right hand , and sat down on the dismantled coffin . three -- four -- five 
 minutes passed , and then potter began to stir and moan . his hand closed 
 upon the knife ; he raised it , glanced at it , and let it fall , with a 
 shudder . then he sat up , pushing the body from him , and gazed at it , and 
 then around him , confusedly . his eyes met joe 's . 

 “ lord , how is this , joe ? ” he said . 

 “ it 's a dirty business , ” said joe , without moving . 

 “ what did you do it for ? ” 

 “ i ! i never done it ! ” 

 “ look here ! that kind of talk wo n't wash . ” 

 potter trembled and grew white . 

 “ i thought i 'd got sober . i 'd no business to drink to - night . but it 's 
 in my head yet -- worse'n when we started here . i 'm all in a muddle ; 
 ca n't recollect anything of it , hardly . tell me , joe--_honest _ , now , 
 old feller -- did i do it ? joe , i never meant to--'pon my soul and honor , i 
 never meant to , joe . tell me how it was , joe . oh , it 's awful -- and him so 
 young and promising . ” 

 “ why , you two was scuffling , and he fetched you one with the headboard 
 and you fell flat ; and then up you come , all reeling and staggering 
 like , and snatched the knife and jammed it into him , just as he fetched 
 you another awful clip -- and here you 've laid , as dead as a wedge til 
 now . ” 

 “ oh , i did n't know what i was a - doing . i wish i may die this minute if i 
 did . it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement , i reckon . 
 i never used a weepon in my life before , joe . i 've fought , but never 
 with weepons . they 'll all say that . joe , do n't tell ! say you wo n't tell , 
 joe -- that 's a good feller . i always liked you , joe , and stood up for you , 
 too . do n't you remember ? you _ wo n't _ tell , _ will _ you , joe ? ” and the 
 poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer , and 
 clasped his appealing hands . 

 “ no , you 've always been fair and square with me , muff potter , and i 
 wo n't go back on you . there , now , that 's as fair as a man can say . ” 

 “ oh , joe , you 're an angel . i 'll bless you for this the longest day i 
 live . ” and potter began to cry . 

 “ come , now , that 's enough of that . this ai n't any time for blubbering . 
 you be off yonder way and i 'll go this . move , now , and do n't leave any 
 tracks behind you . ” 

 potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run . the half - breed 
 stood looking after him . he muttered : 

 “ if he 's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he 
 had the look of being , he wo n't think of the knife till he 's gone so 
 far he 'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by 
 himself -- chicken - heart ! ” 

 two or three minutes later the murdered man , the blanketed corpse , the 
 lidless coffin , and the open grave were under no inspection but the 
 moon 's . the stillness was complete again , too . 




 chapter x 

 the two boys flew on and on , toward the village , speechless with 
 horror . they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time , 
 apprehensively , as if they feared they might be followed . every stump 
 that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy , and made them 
 catch their breath ; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay 
 near the village , the barking of the aroused watch - dogs seemed to give 
 wings to their feet . 

 “ if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down ! ” whispered 
 tom , in short catches between breaths . “ i ca n't stand it much longer . ” 

 huckleberry 's hard pantings were his only reply , and the boys fixed 
 their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it . 
 they gained steadily on it , and at last , breast to breast , they burst 
 through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering 
 shadows beyond . by and by their pulses slowed down , and tom whispered : 

 “ huckleberry , what do you reckon'll come of this ? ” 

 “ if doctor robinson dies , i reckon hanging'll come of it . ” 

 “ do you though ? ” 

 “ why , i _ know _ it , tom . ” 

 tom thought a while , then he said : 

 “ who 'll tell ? we ? ” 

 “ what are you talking about ? s'pose something happened and injun joe 
 _ did n't _ hang ? why , he 'd kill us some time or other , just as dead sure 
 as we 're a laying here . ” 

 “ that 's just what i was thinking to myself , huck . ” 

 “ if anybody tells , let muff potter do it , if he 's fool enough . he 's 
 generally drunk enough . ” 

 tom said nothing -- went on thinking . presently he whispered : 

 “ huck , muff potter do n't know it . how can he tell ? ” 

 “ what 's the reason he do n't know it ? ” 

 “ because he 'd just got that whack when injun joe done it . d'you reckon 
 he could see anything ? d'you reckon he knowed anything ? ” 

 “ by hokey , that 's so , tom ! ” 

 “ and besides , look - a - here -- maybe that whack done for _ him _ ! ” 

 “ no , ' taint likely , tom . he had liquor in him ; i could see that ; and 
 besides , he always has . well , when pap 's full , you might take and belt 
 him over the head with a church and you could n't phase him . he says so , 
 his own self . so it 's the same with muff potter , of course . but if a man 
 was dead sober , i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him ; i dono . ” 

 after another reflective silence , tom said : 

 “ hucky , you sure you can keep mum ? ” 

 “ tom , we _ got _ to keep mum . you know that . that injun devil would n't 
 make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats , if we was to squeak 
 'bout this and they did n't hang him . now , look - a - here , tom , less take 
 and swear to one another -- that 's what we got to do -- swear to keep mum . ” 

 “ i 'm agreed . it 's the best thing . would you just hold hands and swear 
 that we-- ” 

 “ oh no , that would n't do for this . that 's good enough for little 
 rubbishy common things -- specially with gals , cuz _ they _ go back on you 
 anyway , and blab if they get in a huff -- but there orter be writing 'bout 
 a big thing like this . and blood . ” 

 tom 's whole being applauded this idea . it was deep , and dark , and awful ; 
 the hour , the circumstances , the surroundings , were in keeping with it . 
 he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon - light , took a 
 little fragment of “ red keel ” out of his pocket , got the moon on 
 his work , and painfully scrawled these lines , emphasizing each slow 
 down - stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth , and letting up the 
 pressure on the up - strokes . [ see next page . ] 

 “ huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they 
 wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot . ” 

 huckleberry was filled with admiration of tom 's facility in writing , and 
 the sublimity of his language . he at once took a pin from his lapel and 
 was going to prick his flesh , but tom said : 

 “ hold on ! do n't do that . a pin 's brass . it might have verdigrease on 
 it . ” 

 “ what 's verdigrease ? ” 

 “ it 's p'ison . that 's what it is . you just swaller some of it once -- you'll 
 see . ” 

 so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles , and each boy pricked 
 the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood . in time , after 
 many squeezes , tom managed to sign his initials , using the ball of his 
 little finger for a pen . then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and 
 an f , and the oath was complete . they buried the shingle close to the 
 wall , with some dismal ceremonies and incantations , and the fetters 
 that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown 
 away . 

 a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined 
 building , now , but they did not notice it . 

 “ tom , ” whispered huckleberry , “ does this keep us from _ ever _ 
 telling--_always _ ? ” 

 “ of course it does . it do n't make any difference _ what _ happens , we got 
 to keep mum . we 'd drop down dead -- don't _ you _ know that ? ” 

 “ yes , i reckon that 's so . ” 

 they continued to whisper for some little time . presently a dog set up 
 a long , lugubrious howl just outside -- within ten feet of them . the boys 
 clasped each other suddenly , in an agony of fright . 

 “ which of us does he mean ? ” gasped huckleberry . 

 “ i dono -- peep through the crack . quick ! ” 

 “ no , _ you _ , tom ! ” 

 “ i can't -- i ca n't _ do _ it , huck ! ” 

 “ please , tom . there ' tis again ! ” 

 “ oh , lordy , i 'm thankful ! ” whispered tom . “ i know his voice . it 's bull 
 harbison . ” * 

 [ * if mr. harbison owned a slave named bull , tom would have spoken of 
 him as “ harbison 's bull , ” but a son or a dog of that name was “ bull 
 harbison . ” ] 

 “ oh , that 's good -- i tell you , tom , i was most scared to death ; i 'd a bet 
 anything it was a _ stray _ dog . ” 

 the dog howled again . the boys ' hearts sank once more . 

 “ oh , my ! that ai n't no bull harbison ! ” whispered huckleberry . “ _ do _ , 
 tom ! ” 

 tom , quaking with fear , yielded , and put his eye to the crack . his 
 whisper was hardly audible when he said : 

 “ oh , huck , _ its a stray dog _ ! ” 

 “ quick , tom , quick ! who does he mean ? ” 

 “ huck , he must mean us both -- we're right together . ” 

 “ oh , tom , i reckon we 're goners . i reckon there ai n't no mistake 'bout 
 where _ i 'll _ go to . i been so wicked . ” 

 “ dad fetch it ! this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a 
 feller 's told _ not _ to do . i might a been good , like sid , if i 'd a 
 tried -- but no , i would n't , of course . but if ever i get off this time , 
 i lay i 'll just _ waller _ in sunday - schools ! ” and tom began to snuffle a 
 little . 

 “ _ you _ bad ! ” and huckleberry began to snuffle too . “ consound it , tom 
 sawyer , you 're just old pie , ' long - side o ' what i am . oh , _ lordy _ , 
 lordy , lordy , i wisht i only had half your chance . ” 

 tom choked off and whispered : 

 “ look , hucky , look ! he 's got his _ back _ to us ! ” 

 hucky looked , with joy in his heart . 

 “ well , he has , by jingoes ! did he before ? ” 

 “ yes , he did . but i , like a fool , never thought . oh , this is bully , you 
 know . _ now _ who can he mean ? ” 

 the howling stopped . tom pricked up his ears . 

 “ sh ! what 's that ? ” he whispered . 

 “ sounds like -- like hogs grunting . no -- it 's somebody snoring , tom . ” 

 “ that _ is _ it ! where ' bouts is it , huck ? ” 

 “ i bleeve it 's down at ' tother end . sounds so , anyway . pap used to sleep 
 there , sometimes , ' long with the hogs , but laws bless you , he just lifts 
 things when _ he _ snores . besides , i reckon he ai n't ever coming back to 
 this town any more . ” 

 the spirit of adventure rose in the boys ' souls once more . 

 “ hucky , do you das't to go if i lead ? ” 

 “ i do n't like to , much . tom , s'pose it 's injun joe ! ” 

 tom quailed . but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the 
 boys agreed to try , with the understanding that they would take to their 
 heels if the snoring stopped . so they went tiptoeing stealthily down , 
 the one behind the other . when they had got to within five steps of the 
 snorer , tom stepped on a stick , and it broke with a sharp snap . the man 
 moaned , writhed a little , and his face came into the moonlight . it was 
 muff potter . the boys ' hearts had stood still , and their hopes too , 
 when the man moved , but their fears passed away now . they tip - toed out , 
 through the broken weather - boarding , and stopped at a little distance 
 to exchange a parting word . that long , lugubrious howl rose on the night 
 air again ! they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few 
 feet of where potter was lying , and _ facing _ potter , with his nose 
 pointing heavenward . 

 “ oh , geeminy , it 's _ him _ ! ” exclaimed both boys , in a breath . 

 “ say , tom -- they say a stray dog come howling around johnny miller 's 
 house , 'bout midnight , as much as two weeks ago ; and a whippoorwill come 
 in and lit on the banisters and sung , the very same evening ; and there 
 ai n't anybody dead there yet . ” 

 “ well , i know that . and suppose there ai n't . did n't gracie miller fall 
 in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday ? ” 

 “ yes , but she ai n't _ dead_. and what 's more , she 's getting better , too . ” 

 “ all right , you wait and see . she 's a goner , just as dead sure as muff 
 potter 's a goner . that 's what the niggers say , and they know all about 
 these kind of things , huck . ” 

 then they separated , cogitating . when tom crept in at his bedroom window 
 the night was almost spent . he undressed with excessive caution , and 
 fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade . he 
 was not aware that the gently - snoring sid was awake , and had been so for 
 an hour . 

 when tom awoke , sid was dressed and gone . there was a late look in the 
 light , a late sense in the atmosphere . he was startled . why had he not 
 been called -- persecuted till he was up , as usual ? the thought filled 
 him with bodings . within five minutes he was dressed and down - stairs , 
 feeling sore and drowsy . the family were still at table , but they had 
 finished breakfast . there was no voice of rebuke ; but there were averted 
 eyes ; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill 
 to the culprit 's heart . he sat down and tried to seem gay , but it 
 was up - hill work ; it roused no smile , no response , and he lapsed into 
 silence and let his heart sink down to the depths . 

 after breakfast his aunt took him aside , and tom almost brightened in 
 the hope that he was going to be flogged ; but it was not so . his aunt 
 wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so ; 
 and finally told him to go on , and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs 
 with sorrow to the grave , for it was no use for her to try any more . 
 this was worse than a thousand whippings , and tom 's heart was sorer now 
 than his body . he cried , he pleaded for forgiveness , promised to reform 
 over and over again , and then received his dismissal , feeling that 
 he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble 
 confidence . 

 he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward 
 sid ; and so the latter 's prompt retreat through the back gate was 
 unnecessary . he moped to school gloomy and sad , and took his flogging , 
 along with joe harper , for playing hookey the day before , with the 
 air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to 
 trifles . then he betook himself to his seat , rested his elbows on his 
 desk and his jaws in his hands , and stared at the wall with the stony 
 stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go . 
 his elbow was pressing against some hard substance . after a long time 
 he slowly and sadly changed his position , and took up this object with 
 a sigh . it was in a paper . he unrolled it . a long , lingering , colossal 
 sigh followed , and his heart broke . it was his brass andiron knob ! 

 this final feather broke the camel 's back . 




 chapter xi 

 close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified 
 with the ghastly news . no need of the as yet un - dreamed - of telegraph ; 
 the tale flew from man to man , from group to group , from house to house , 
 with little less than telegraphic speed . of course the schoolmaster gave 
 holi - day for that afternoon ; the town would have thought strangely of 
 him if he had not . 

 a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man , and it had been 
 recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter -- so the story ran . and 
 it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself 
 in the “ branch ” about one or two o'clock in the morning , and that potter 
 had at once sneaked off -- suspicious circumstances , especially the washing 
 which was not a habit with potter . it was also said that the town had 
 been ransacked for this “ murderer ” ( the public are not slow in the 
 matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict ) , but that he 
 could not be found . horsemen had departed down all the roads in every 
 direction , and the sheriff “ was confident ” that he would be captured 
 before night . 

 all the town was drifting toward the graveyard . tom 's heartbreak 
 vanished and he joined the procession , not because he would not 
 a thousand times rather go anywhere else , but because an awful , 
 unaccountable fascination drew him on . arrived at the dreadful place , he 
 wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle . 
 it seemed to him an age since he was there before . somebody pinched 
 his arm . he turned , and his eyes met huckleberry 's . then both looked 
 elsewhere at once , and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their 
 mutual glance . but everybody was talking , and intent upon the grisly 
 spectacle before them . 

 “ poor fellow ! ” “ poor young fellow ! ” “ this ought to be a lesson to grave 
 robbers ! ” “ muff potter'll hang for this if they catch him ! ” this was the 
 drift of remark ; and the minister said , “ it was a judgment ; his hand is 
 here . ” 

 now tom shivered from head to heel ; for his eye fell upon the stolid 
 face of injun joe . at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle , 
 and voices shouted , “ it 's him ! it 's him ! he 's coming himself ! ” 

 “ who ? who ? ” from twenty voices . 

 “ muff potter ! ” 

 “ hallo , he 's stopped!--look out , he 's turning ! do n't let him get away ! ” 

 people in the branches of the trees over tom 's head said he was n't 
 trying to get away -- he only looked doubtful and perplexed . 

 “ infernal impudence ! ” said a bystander ; “ wanted to come and take a quiet 
 look at his work , i reckon -- didn't expect any company . ” 

 the crowd fell apart , now , and the sheriff came through , ostentatiously 
 leading potter by the arm . the poor fellow 's face was haggard , and 
 his eyes showed the fear that was upon him . when he stood before the 
 murdered man , he shook as with a palsy , and he put his face in his hands 
 and burst into tears . 

 “ i did n't do it , friends , ” he sobbed ; “ ' pon my word and honor i never 
 done it . ” 

 “ who 's accused you ? ” shouted a voice . 

 this shot seemed to carry home . potter lifted his face and looked around 
 him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes . he saw injun joe , and 
 exclaimed : 

 “ oh , injun joe , you promised me you 'd never-- ” 

 “ is that your knife ? ” and it was thrust before him by the sheriff . 

 potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the 
 ground . then he said : 

 “ something told me ' t if i did n't come back and get-- ” he shuddered ; then 
 waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said , “ tell 'em , 
 joe , tell ' em -- it ai n't any use any more . ” 

 then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring , and heard the 
 stony - hearted liar reel off his serene statement , they expecting every 
 moment that the clear sky would deliver god 's lightnings upon his head , 
 and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed . and when he had 
 finished and still stood alive and whole , their wavering impulse to 
 break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner 's life faded and 
 vanished away , for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and 
 it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that . 

 “ why did n't you leave ? what did you want to come here for ? ” somebody 
 said . 

 “ i could n't help it -- i could n't help it , ” potter moaned . “ i wanted to 
 run away , but i could n't seem to come anywhere but here . ” and he fell to 
 sobbing again . 

 injun joe repeated his statement , just as calmly , a few minutes 
 afterward on the inquest , under oath ; and the boys , seeing that the 
 lightnings were still withheld , were confirmed in their belief that 
 joe had sold himself to the devil . he was now become , to them , the most 
 balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon , and they could 
 not take their fascinated eyes from his face . 

 they inwardly resolved to watch him nights , when opportunity should 
 offer , in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master . 

 injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in 
 a wagon for removal ; and it was whispered through the shuddering 
 crowd that the wound bled a little ! the boys thought that this happy 
 circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction ; but they were 
 disappointed , for more than one villager remarked : 

 “ it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it . ” 

 tom 's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as 
 much as a week after this ; and at breakfast one morning sid said : 

 “ tom , you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me 
 awake half the time . ” 

 tom blanched and dropped his eyes . 

 “ it 's a bad sign , ” said aunt polly , gravely . “ what you got on your mind , 
 tom ? ” 

 “ nothing . nothing ' t i know of . ” but the boy 's hand shook so that he 
 spilled his coffee . 

 “ and you do talk such stuff , ” sid said . “ last night you said , ' it 's 
 blood , it 's blood , that 's what it is ! ' you said that over and over . 
 and you said , ' do n't torment me so -- i'll tell ! ' tell _ what _ ? what is it 
 you 'll tell ? ” 

 everything was swimming before tom . there is no telling what might have 
 happened , now , but luckily the concern passed out of aunt polly 's face 
 and she came to tom 's relief without knowing it . she said : 

 “ sho ! it 's that dreadful murder . i dream about it most every night 
 myself . sometimes i dream it 's me that done it . ” 

 mary said she had been affected much the same way . sid seemed satisfied . 
 tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could , and after 
 that he complained of toothache for a week , and tied up his jaws every 
 night . he never knew that sid lay nightly watching , and frequently 
 slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good 
 while at a time , and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place 
 again . tom 's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew 
 irksome and was discarded . if sid really managed to make anything out of 
 tom 's disjointed mutterings , he kept it to himself . 

 it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding 
 inquests on dead cats , and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind . 
 sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries , 
 though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises ; 
 he noticed , too , that tom never acted as a witness -- and that was strange ; 
 and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion 
 to these inquests , and always avoided them when he could . sid marvelled , 
 but said nothing . however , even inquests went out of vogue at last , and 
 ceased to torture tom 's conscience . 

 every day or two , during this time of sorrow , tom watched his 
 opportunity and went to the little grated jail - window and smuggled such 
 small comforts through to the “ murderer ” as he could get hold of . the 
 jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge 
 of the village , and no guards were afforded for it ; indeed , it 
 was seldom occupied . these offerings greatly helped to ease tom 's 
 conscience . 

 the villagers had a strong desire to tar - and - feather injun joe and ride 
 him on a rail , for body - snatching , but so formidable was his character 
 that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the 
 matter , so it was dropped . he had been careful to begin both of his 
 inquest - statements with the fight , without confessing the grave - robbery 
 that preceded it ; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in 
 the courts at present . 




 chapter xii 

 one of the reasons why tom 's mind had drifted away from its secret 
 troubles was , that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest 
 itself about . becky thatcher had stopped coming to school . tom had 
 struggled with his pride a few days , and tried to “ whistle her down the 
 wind , ” but failed . he began to find himself hanging around her father 's 
 house , nights , and feeling very miserable . she was ill . what if she 
 should die ! there was distraction in the thought . he no longer took an 
 interest in war , nor even in piracy . the charm of life was gone ; there 
 was nothing but dreariness left . he put his hoop away , and his bat ; 
 there was no joy in them any more . his aunt was concerned . she began to 
 try all manner of remedies on him . she was one of those people who 
 are infatuated with patent medicines and all new - fangled methods of 
 producing health or mending it . she was an inveterate experimenter in 
 these things . when something fresh in this line came out she was in a 
 fever , right away , to try it ; not on herself , for she was never ailing , 
 but on anybody else that came handy . she was a subscriber for all the 
 “ health ” periodicals and phrenological frauds ; and the solemn ignorance 
 they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils . all the “ rot ” they 
 contained about ventilation , and how to go to bed , and how to get up , 
 and what to eat , and what to drink , and how much exercise to take , and 
 what frame of mind to keep one 's self in , and what sort of clothing 
 to wear , was all gospel to her , and she never observed that her 
 health - journals of the current month customarily upset everything they 
 had recommended the month before . she was as simple - hearted and honest 
 as the day was long , and so she was an easy victim . she gathered 
 together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines , and thus armed 
 with death , went about on her pale horse , metaphorically speaking , with 
 “ hell following after . ” but she never suspected that she was not an 
 angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise , to the suffering 
 neighbors . 

 the water treatment was new , now , and tom 's low condition was a windfall 
 to her . she had him out at daylight every morning , stood him up in the 
 wood - shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water ; then she scrubbed 
 him down with a towel like a file , and so brought him to ; then she 
 rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she 
 sweated his soul clean and “ the yellow stains of it came through his 
 pores”--as tom said . 

 yet notwithstanding all this , the boy grew more and more melancholy and 
 pale and dejected . she added hot baths , sitz baths , shower baths , and 
 plunges . the boy remained as dismal as a hearse . she began to assist the 
 water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister - plasters . she calculated his 
 capacity as she would a jug 's , and filled him up every day with quack 
 cure - alls . 

 tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time . this phase 
 filled the old lady 's heart with consternation . this indifference must 
 be broken up at any cost . now she heard of pain - killer for the first 
 time . she ordered a lot at once . she tasted it and was filled with 
 gratitude . it was simply fire in a liquid form . she dropped the water 
 treatment and everything else , and pinned her faith to pain - killer . 
 she gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the 
 result . her troubles were instantly at rest , her soul at peace again ; 
 for the “ indifference ” was broken up . the boy could not have shown a 
 wilder , heartier interest , if she had built a fire under him . 

 tom felt that it was time to wake up ; this sort of life might be 
 romantic enough , in his blighted condition , but it was getting to have 
 too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it . so he 
 thought over various plans for relief , and finally hit upon that of 
 professing to be fond of pain - killer . he asked for it so often that he 
 became a nuisance , and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and 
 quit bothering her . if it had been sid , she would have had no misgivings 
 to alloy her delight ; but since it was tom , she watched the bottle 
 clandestinely . she found that the medicine did really diminish , but it 
 did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in 
 the sitting - room floor with it . 

 one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt 's yellow 
 cat came along , purring , eyeing the teaspoon avariciously , and begging 
 for a taste . tom said : 

 “ do n't ask for it unless you want it , peter . ” 

 but peter signified that he did want it . 

 “ you better make sure . ” 

 peter was sure . 

 “ now you 've asked for it , and i 'll give it to you , because there ai n't 
 anything mean about me ; but if you find you do n't like it , you must n't 
 blame anybody but your own self . ” 

 peter was agreeable . so tom pried his mouth open and poured down 
 the pain - killer . peter sprang a couple of yards in the air , and then 
 delivered a war - whoop and set off round and round the room , banging 
 against furniture , upsetting flower - pots , and making general havoc . next 
 he rose on his hind feet and pranced around , in a frenzy of enjoyment , 
 with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his 
 unappeasable happiness . then he went tearing around the house again 
 spreading chaos and destruction in his path . aunt polly entered in time 
 to see him throw a few double summersets , deliver a final mighty hurrah , 
 and sail through the open window , carrying the rest of the flower - pots 
 with him . the old lady stood petrified with astonishment , peering over 
 her glasses ; tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter . 

 “ tom , what on earth ails that cat ? ” 

 “ i do n't know , aunt , ” gasped the boy . 

 “ why , i never see anything like it . what did make him act so ? ” 

 “ deed i do n't know , aunt polly ; cats always act so when they 're having a 
 good time . ” 

 “ they do , do they ? ” there was something in the tone that made tom 
 apprehensive . 

 “ yes'm . that is , i believe they do . ” 

 “ you _ do _ ? ” 

 “ yes'm . ” 

 the old lady was bending down , tom watching , with interest emphasized 
 by anxiety . too late he divined her “ drift . ” the handle of the telltale 
 tea - spoon was visible under the bed - valance . aunt polly took it , held it 
 up . tom winced , and dropped his eyes . aunt polly raised him by the usual 
 handle -- his ear -- and cracked his head soundly with her thimble . 

 “ now , sir , what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so , for ? ” 

 “ i done it out of pity for him -- because he had n't any aunt . ” 

 “ had n't any aunt!--you numskull . what has that got to do with it ? ” 

 “ heaps . because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself ! she 'd a 
 roasted his bowels out of him ' thout any more feeling than if he was a 
 human ! ” 

 aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse . this was putting the thing in 
 a new light ; what was cruelty to a cat _ might _ be cruelty to a boy , too . 
 she began to soften ; she felt sorry . her eyes watered a little , and she 
 put her hand on tom 's head and said gently : 

 “ i was meaning for the best , tom . and , tom , it _ did _ do you good . ” 

 tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping 
 through his gravity . 

 “ i know you was meaning for the best , aunty , and so was i with peter . it 
 done _ him _ good , too . i never see him get around so since-- ” 

 “ oh , go ' long with you , tom , before you aggravate me again . and you try 
 and see if you ca n't be a good boy , for once , and you need n't take any 
 more medicine . ” 

 tom reached school ahead of time . it was noticed that this strange thing 
 had been occurring every day latterly . and now , as usual of late , 
 he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his 
 comrades . he was sick , he said , and he looked it . he tried to seem to 
 be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking -- down the road . 
 presently jeff thatcher hove in sight , and tom 's face lighted ; he gazed 
 a moment , and then turned sorrowfully away . when jeff arrived , tom 
 accosted him ; and “ led up ” warily to opportunities for remark about 
 becky , but the giddy lad never could see the bait . tom watched and 
 watched , hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight , and hating the 
 owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one . at last frocks 
 ceased to appear , and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps ; he entered 
 the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer . then one more frock passed 
 in at the gate , and tom 's heart gave a great bound . the next instant he 
 was out , and “ going on ” like an indian ; yelling , laughing , chasing boys , 
 jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb , throwing handsprings , 
 standing on his head -- doing all the heroic things he could conceive of , 
 and keeping a furtive eye out , all the while , to see if becky thatcher 
 was noticing . but she seemed to be unconscious of it all ; she never 
 looked . could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there ? 
 he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity ; came war - whooping 
 around , snatched a boy 's cap , hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse , 
 broke through a group of boys , tumbling them in every direction , and 
 fell sprawling , himself , under becky 's nose , almost upsetting her -- and 
 she turned , with her nose in the air , and he heard her say : “ mf ! some 
 people think they 're mighty smart -- always showing off ! ” 

 tom 's cheeks burned . he gathered himself up and sneaked off , crushed and 
 crestfallen . 




 chapter xiii 

 tom 's mind was made up now . he was gloomy and desperate . he was a 
 forsaken , friendless boy , he said ; nobody loved him ; when they found out 
 what they had driven him to , perhaps they would be sorry ; he had tried 
 to do right and get along , but they would not let him ; since nothing 
 would do them but to be rid of him , let it be so ; and let them blame 
 _ him _ for the consequences -- why should n't they ? what right had the 
 friendless to complain ? yes , they had forced him to it at last : he would 
 lead a life of crime . there was no choice . 

 by this time he was far down meadow lane , and the bell for school to 
 “ take up ” tinkled faintly upon his ear . he sobbed , now , to think he 
 should never , never hear that old familiar sound any more -- it was very 
 hard , but it was forced on him ; since he was driven out into the cold 
 world , he must submit -- but he forgave them . then the sobs came thick and 
 fast . 

 just at this point he met his soul 's sworn comrade , joe 
 harper -- hard - eyed , and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his 
 heart . plainly here were “ two souls with but a single thought . ” tom , 
 wiping his eyes with his sleeve , began to blubber out something about 
 a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by 
 roaming abroad into the great world never to return ; and ended by hoping 
 that joe would not forget him . 

 but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been going 
 to make of tom , and had come to hunt him up for that purpose . his mother 
 had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and 
 knew nothing about ; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished 
 him to go ; if she felt that way , there was nothing for him to do but 
 succumb ; he hoped she would be happy , and never regret having driven her 
 poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die . 

 as the two boys walked sorrowing along , they made a new compact to stand 
 by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved 
 them of their troubles . then they began to lay their plans . joe was for 
 being a hermit , and living on crusts in a remote cave , and dying , 
 some time , of cold and want and grief ; but after listening to tom , he 
 conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of 
 crime , and so he consented to be a pirate . 

 three miles below st. petersburg , at a point where the mississippi river 
 was a trifle over a mile wide , there was a long , narrow , wooded island , 
 with a shallow bar at the head of it , and this offered well as a 
 rendezvous . it was not inhabited ; it lay far over toward the further 
 shore , abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest . so jackson 's 
 island was chosen . who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a 
 matter that did not occur to them . then they hunted up huckleberry finn , 
 and he joined them promptly , for all careers were one to him ; he was 
 indifferent . they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the 
 river - bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour -- which was 
 midnight . there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture . 
 each would bring hooks and lines , and such provision as he could steal 
 in the most dark and mysterious way -- as became outlaws . and before the 
 afternoon was done , they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of 
 spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “ hear something . ” all 
 who got this vague hint were cautioned to “ be mum and wait . ” 

 about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles , 
 and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the 
 meeting - place . it was starlight , and very still . the mighty river lay 
 like an ocean at rest . tom listened a moment , but no sound disturbed the 
 quiet . then he gave a low , distinct whistle . it was answered from under 
 the bluff . tom whistled twice more ; these signals were answered in the 
 same way . then a guarded voice said : 

 “ who goes there ? ” 

 “ tom sawyer , the black avenger of the spanish main . name your names . ” 

 “ huck finn the red - handed , and joe harper the terror of the seas . ” tom 
 had furnished these titles , from his favorite literature . 

 “ ' tis well . give the countersign . ” 

 two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the 
 brooding night : 

 “ _ blood _ ! ” 

 then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it , 
 tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort . there was 
 an easy , comfortable path along the shore under the bluff , but it lacked 
 the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate . 

 the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon , and had about worn 
 himself out with getting it there . finn the red - handed had stolen a 
 skillet and a quantity of half - cured leaf tobacco , and had also brought 
 a few corn - cobs to make pipes with . but none of the pirates smoked or 
 “ chewed ” but himself . the black avenger of the spanish main said it 
 would never do to start without some fire . that was a wise thought ; 
 matches were hardly known there in that day . they saw a fire smouldering 
 upon a great raft a hundred yards above , and they went stealthily 
 thither and helped themselves to a chunk . they made an imposing 
 adventure of it , saying , “ hist ! ” every now and then , and suddenly 
 halting with finger on lip ; moving with hands on imaginary dagger - hilts ; 
 and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “ the foe ” stirred , to “ let 
 him have it to the hilt , ” because “ dead men tell no tales . ” they knew 
 well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying 
 in stores or having a spree , but still that was no excuse for their 
 conducting this thing in an unpiratical way . 

 they shoved off , presently , tom in command , huck at the after oar and 
 joe at the forward . tom stood amidships , gloomy - browed , and with folded 
 arms , and gave his orders in a low , stern whisper : 

 “ luff , and bring her to the wind ! ” 

 “ aye - aye , sir ! ” 

 “ steady , steady - y - y - y ! ” 

 “ steady it is , sir ! ” 

 “ let her go off a point ! ” 

 “ point it is , sir ! ” 

 as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid - stream 
 it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for 
 “ style , ” and were not intended to mean anything in particular . 

 “ what sail 's she carrying ? ” 

 “ courses , tops'ls , and flying - jib , sir . ” 

 “ send the r'yals up ! lay out aloft , there , half a dozen of 
 ye -- foretopmaststuns'l ! lively , now ! ” 

 “ aye - aye , sir ! ” 

 “ shake out that maintogalans'l ! sheets and braces ! _ now _ my hearties ! ” 

 “ aye - aye , sir ! ” 

 “ hellum - a - lee -- hard a port ! stand by to meet her when she comes ! port , 
 port ! _ now _ , men ! with a will ! stead - y - y - y ! ” 

 “ steady it is , sir ! ” 

 the raft drew beyond the middle of the river ; the boys pointed her head 
 right , and then lay on their oars . the river was not high , so there was 
 not more than a two or three mile current . hardly a word was said during 
 the next three - quarters of an hour . now the raft was passing before 
 the distant town . two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay , 
 peacefully sleeping , beyond the vague vast sweep of star - gemmed water , 
 unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening . the black 
 avenger stood still with folded arms , “ looking his last ” upon the scene 
 of his former joys and his later sufferings , and wishing “ she ” could see 
 him now , abroad on the wild sea , facing peril and death with dauntless 
 heart , going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips . it was but 
 a small strain on his imagination to remove jackson 's island beyond 
 eye - shot of the village , and so he “ looked his last ” with a broken and 
 satisfied heart . the other pirates were looking their last , too ; and 
 they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift 
 them out of the range of the island . but they discovered the danger in 
 time , and made shift to avert it . about two o'clock in the morning the 
 raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island , 
 and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight . part 
 of the little raft 's belongings consisted of an old sail , and this they 
 spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions ; 
 but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather , as 
 became outlaws . 

 they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps 
 within the sombre depths of the forest , and then cooked some bacon in 
 the frying - pan for supper , and used up half of the corn “ pone ” stock 
 they had brought . it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild , 
 free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island , 
 far from the haunts of men , and they said they never would return to 
 civilization . the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy 
 glare upon the pillared tree - trunks of their forest temple , and upon the 
 varnished foliage and festooning vines . 

 when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone , and the last allowance 
 of corn pone devoured , the boys stretched themselves out on the grass , 
 filled with contentment . they could have found a cooler place , but 
 they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting 
 campfire . 

 “ _ ai n't _ it gay ? ” said joe . 

 “ it 's _ nuts _ ! ” said tom . “ what would the boys say if they could see us ? ” 

 “ say ? well , they 'd just die to be here -- hey , hucky ! ” 

 “ i reckon so , ” said huckleberry ; “ anyways , i 'm suited . i do n't want 
 nothing better'n this . i do n't ever get enough to eat , gen'ally -- and here 
 they ca n't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so . ” 

 “ it 's just the life for me , ” said tom . “ you do n't have to get up , 
 mornings , and you do n't have to go to school , and wash , and all that 
 blame foolishness . you see a pirate do n't have to do _ anything _ , joe , 
 when he 's ashore , but a hermit _ he _ has to be praying considerable , and 
 then he do n't have any fun , anyway , all by himself that way . ” 

 “ oh yes , that 's so , ” said joe , “ but i had n't thought much about it , you 
 know . i 'd a good deal rather be a pirate , now that i 've tried it . ” 

 “ you see , ” said tom , “ people do n't go much on hermits , nowadays , like 
 they used to in old times , but a pirate 's always respected . and 
 a hermit 's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find , and put 
 sackcloth and ashes on his head , and stand out in the rain , and-- ” 

 “ what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for ? ” inquired huck . 

 “ i dono . but they 've _ got _ to do it . hermits always do . you 'd have to do 
 that if you was a hermit . ” 

 “ dern'd if i would , ” said huck . 

 “ well , what would you do ? ” 

 “ i dono . but i would n't do that . ” 

 “ why , huck , you 'd _ have _ to . how 'd you get around it ? ” 

 “ why , i just would n't stand it . i 'd run away . ” 

 “ run away ! well , you _ would _ be a nice old slouch of a hermit . you 'd be 
 a disgrace . ” 

 the red - handed made no response , being better employed . he had finished 
 gouging out a cob , and now he fitted a weed stem to it , loaded it with 
 tobacco , and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of 
 fragrant smoke -- he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment . the 
 other pirates envied him this majestic vice , and secretly resolved to 
 acquire it shortly . presently huck said : 

 “ what does pirates have to do ? ” 

 tom said : 

 “ oh , they have just a bully time -- take ships and burn them , and get the 
 money and bury it in awful places in their island where there 's ghosts 
 and things to watch it , and kill everybody in the ships -- make 'em walk a 
 plank . ” 

 “ and they carry the women to the island , ” said joe ; “ they do n't kill the 
 women . ” 

 “ no , ” assented tom , “ they do n't kill the women -- they're too noble . and 
 the women 's always beautiful , too . 

 “ and do n't they wear the bulliest clothes ! oh no ! all gold and silver 
 and di'monds , ” said joe , with enthusiasm . 

 “ who ? ” said huck . 

 “ why , the pirates . ” 

 huck scanned his own clothing forlornly . 

 “ i reckon i ai n't dressed fitten for a pirate , ” said he , with a 
 regretful pathos in his voice ; “ but i ai n't got none but these . ” 

 but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough , 
 after they should have begun their adventures . they made him understand 
 that his poor rags would do to begin with , though it was customary for 
 wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe . 

 gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the 
 eyelids of the little waifs . the pipe dropped from the fingers of the 
 red - handed , and he slept the sleep of the conscience - free and the weary . 
 the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had 
 more difficulty in getting to sleep . they said their prayers inwardly , 
 and lying down , since there was nobody there with authority to make them 
 kneel and recite aloud ; in truth , they had a mind not to say them at 
 all , but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that , lest they 
 might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven . then at 
 once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep -- but an 
 intruder came , now , that would not “ down . ” it was conscience . they began 
 to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away ; and 
 next they thought of the stolen meat , and then the real torture came . 
 they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had 
 purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times ; but conscience was not 
 to be appeased by such thin plausibilities ; it seemed to them , in the 
 end , that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking 
 sweetmeats was only “ hooking , ” while taking bacon and hams and such 
 valuables was plain simple stealing -- and there was a command against that 
 in the bible . so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in 
 the business , their piracies should not again be sullied with the 
 crime of stealing . then conscience granted a truce , and these curiously 
 inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep . 




 chapter xiv 

 when tom awoke in the morning , he wondered where he was . he sat up and 
 rubbed his eyes and looked around . then he comprehended . it was the cool 
 gray dawn , and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the 
 deep pervading calm and silence of the woods . not a leaf stirred ; not 
 a sound obtruded upon great nature 's meditation . beaded dewdrops stood 
 upon the leaves and grasses . a white layer of ashes covered the fire , 
 and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air . joe and huck 
 still slept . 

 now , far away in the woods a bird called ; another answered ; presently 
 the hammering of a woodpecker was heard . gradually the cool dim gray 
 of the morning whitened , and as gradually sounds multiplied and life 
 manifested itself . the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going 
 to work unfolded itself to the musing boy . a little green worm came 
 crawling over a dewy leaf , lifting two - thirds of his body into the air 
 from time to time and “ sniffing around , ” then proceeding again -- for he 
 was measuring , tom said ; and when the worm approached him , of its own 
 accord , he sat as still as a stone , with his hopes rising and falling , 
 by turns , as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to 
 go elsewhere ; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its 
 curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon tom 's leg and 
 began a journey over him , his whole heart was glad -- for that meant that 
 he was going to have a new suit of clothes -- without the shadow of a 
 doubt a gaudy piratical uniform . now a procession of ants appeared , 
 from nowhere in particular , and went about their labors ; one struggled 
 manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms , 
 and lugged it straight up a tree - trunk . a brown spotted lady - bug climbed 
 the dizzy height of a grass blade , and tom bent down close to it and 
 said , “ lady - bug , lady - bug , fly away home , your house is on fire , your 
 children 's alone , ” and she took wing and went off to see about it -- which 
 did not surprise the boy , for he knew of old that this insect was 
 credulous about conflagrations , and he had practised upon its simplicity 
 more than once . a tumblebug came next , heaving sturdily at its ball , and 
 tom touched the creature , to see it shut its legs against its body 
 and pretend to be dead . the birds were fairly rioting by this time . a 
 catbird , the northern mocker , lit in a tree over tom 's head , and trilled 
 out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment ; then 
 a shrill jay swept down , a flash of blue flame , and stopped on a twig 
 almost within the boy 's reach , cocked his head to one side and eyed the 
 strangers with a consuming curiosity ; a gray squirrel and a big fellow 
 of the “ fox ” kind came skurrying along , sitting up at intervals to 
 inspect and chatter at the boys , for the wild things had probably never 
 seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not . 
 all nature was wide awake and stirring , now ; long lances of sunlight 
 pierced down through the dense foliage far and near , and a few 
 butterflies came fluttering upon the scene . 

 tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with 
 a shout , and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and 
 tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white 
 sandbar . they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the 
 distance beyond the majestic waste of water . a vagrant current or a 
 slight rise in the river had carried off their raft , but this only 
 gratified them , since its going was something like burning the bridge 
 between them and civilization . 

 they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed , glad - hearted , and 
 ravenous ; and they soon had the camp - fire blazing up again . huck found a 
 spring of clear cold water close by , and the boys made cups of broad oak 
 or hickory leaves , and felt that water , sweetened with such a wildwood 
 charm as that , would be a good enough substitute for coffee . while joe 
 was slicing bacon for breakfast , tom and huck asked him to hold on a 
 minute ; they stepped to a promising nook in the river - bank and threw in 
 their lines ; almost immediately they had reward . joe had not had time 
 to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass , 
 a couple of sun - perch and a small catfish -- provisions enough for quite a 
 family . they fried the fish with the bacon , and were astonished ; for 
 no fish had ever seemed so delicious before . they did not know that the 
 quicker a fresh - water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better 
 he is ; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open - air sleeping , 
 open - air exercise , bathing , and a large ingredient of hunger make , too . 

 they lay around in the shade , after breakfast , while huck had a smoke , 
 and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition . they 
 tramped gayly along , over decaying logs , through tangled underbrush , 
 among solemn monarchs of the forest , hung from their crowns to the 
 ground with a drooping regalia of grape - vines . now and then they came 
 upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers . 

 they found plenty of things to be delighted with , but nothing to be 
 astonished at . they discovered that the island was about three miles 
 long and a quarter of a mile wide , and that the shore it lay closest to 
 was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards 
 wide . they took a swim about every hour , so it was close upon the middle 
 of the afternoon when they got back to camp . they were too hungry to 
 stop to fish , but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham , and then threw 
 themselves down in the shade to talk . but the talk soon began to drag , 
 and then died . the stillness , the solemnity that brooded in the woods , 
 and the sense of loneliness , began to tell upon the spirits of the boys . 
 they fell to thinking . a sort of undefined longing crept upon them . this 
 took dim shape , presently -- it was budding homesickness . even finn the 
 red - handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads . but they 
 were all ashamed of their weakness , and none was brave enough to speak 
 his thought . 

 for some time , now , the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar 
 sound in the distance , just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a 
 clock which he takes no distinct note of . but now this mysterious sound 
 became more pronounced , and forced a recognition . the boys started , 
 glanced at each other , and then each assumed a listening attitude . there 
 was a long silence , profound and unbroken ; then a deep , sullen boom came 
 floating down out of the distance . 

 “ what is it ! ” exclaimed joe , under his breath . 

 “ i wonder , ” said tom in a whisper . 

 “ ' tain't thunder , ” said huckleberry , in an awed tone , “ becuz thunder-- ” 

 “ hark ! ” said tom . “ listen -- don't talk . ” 

 they waited a time that seemed an age , and then the same muffled boom 
 troubled the solemn hush . 

 “ let 's go and see . ” 

 they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town . they 
 parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water . the little 
 steam ferry - boat was about a mile below the village , drifting with the 
 current . her broad deck seemed crowded with people . there were a great 
 many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood 
 of the ferryboat , but the boys could not determine what the men in 
 them were doing . presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the 
 ferryboat 's side , and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud , that same 
 dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again . 

 “ i know now ! ” exclaimed tom ; “ somebody 's drownded ! ” 

 “ that 's it ! ” said huck ; “ they done that last summer , when bill turner 
 got drownded ; they shoot a cannon over the water , and that makes 
 him come up to the top . yes , and they take loaves of bread and put 
 quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat , and wherever there 's anybody 
 that 's drownded , they 'll float right there and stop . ” 

 “ yes , i 've heard about that , ” said joe . “ i wonder what makes the bread 
 do that . ” 

 “ oh , it ai n't the bread , so much , ” said tom ; “ i reckon it 's mostly what 
 they _ say _ over it before they start it out . ” 

 “ but they do n't say anything over it , ” said huck . “ i 've seen 'em and 
 they do n't . ” 

 “ well , that 's funny , ” said tom . “ but maybe they say it to themselves . of 
 _ course _ they do . anybody might know that . ” 

 the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said , because 
 an ignorant lump of bread , uninstructed by an incantation , could not 
 be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such 
 gravity . 

 “ by jings , i wish i was over there , now , ” said joe . 

 “ i do too ” said huck “ i 'd give heaps to know who it is . ” 

 the boys still listened and watched . presently a revealing thought 
 flashed through tom 's mind , and he exclaimed : 

 “ boys , i know who 's drownded -- it 's us ! ” 

 they felt like heroes in an instant . here was a gorgeous triumph ; they 
 were missed ; they were mourned ; hearts were breaking on their account ; 
 tears were being shed ; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor 
 lost lads were rising up , and unavailing regrets and remorse were being 
 indulged ; and best of all , the departed were the talk of the whole town , 
 and the envy of all the boys , as far as this dazzling notoriety was 
 concerned . this was fine . it was worth while to be a pirate , after all . 

 as twilight drew on , the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business 
 and the skiffs disappeared . the pirates returned to camp . they were 
 jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble 
 they were making . they caught fish , cooked supper and ate it , and then 
 fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them ; 
 and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were 
 gratifying to look upon -- from their point of view . but when the shadows 
 of night closed them in , they gradually ceased to talk , and sat gazing 
 into the fire , with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere . the 
 excitement was gone , now , and tom and joe could not keep back thoughts 
 of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as 
 much as they were . misgivings came ; they grew troubled and unhappy ; a 
 sigh or two escaped , unawares . by and by joe timidly ventured upon a 
 roundabout “ feeler ” as to how the others might look upon a return to 
 civilization -- not right now , but-- 

 tom withered him with derision ! huck , being uncommitted as yet , joined 
 in with tom , and the waverer quickly “ explained , ” and was glad to get 
 out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken - hearted home - sickness 
 clinging to his garments as he could . mutiny was effectually laid to 
 rest for the moment . 

 as the night deepened , huck began to nod , and presently to snore . 
 joe followed next . tom lay upon his elbow motionless , for some time , 
 watching the two intently . at last he got up cautiously , on his knees , 
 and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung 
 by the campfire . he picked up and inspected several large semi - cylinders 
 of the thin white bark of a sycamore , and finally chose two which seemed 
 to suit him . then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something 
 upon each of these with his “ red keel ” ; one he rolled up and put in his 
 jacket pocket , and the other he put in joe 's hat and removed it to a 
 little distance from the owner . and he also put into the hat certain 
 schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value -- among them a lump of 
 chalk , an india - rubber ball , three fishhooks , and one of that kind 
 of marbles known as a “ sure ' nough crystal . ” then he tiptoed his way 
 cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing , and 
 straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar . 




 chapter xv 

 a few minutes later tom was in the shoal water of the bar , wading toward 
 the illinois shore . before the depth reached his middle he was halfway 
 over ; the current would permit no more wading , now , so he struck out 
 confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards . he swam quartering 
 upstream , but still was swept downward rather faster than he had 
 expected . however , he reached the shore finally , and drifted along till 
 he found a low place and drew himself out . he put his hand on his jacket 
 pocket , found his piece of bark safe , and then struck through the woods , 
 following the shore , with streaming garments . shortly before ten 
 o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village , and saw the 
 ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank . everything 
 was quiet under the blinking stars . he crept down the bank , watching 
 with all his eyes , slipped into the water , swam three or four strokes 
 and climbed into the skiff that did “ yawl ” duty at the boat 's stern . he 
 laid himself down under the thwarts and waited , panting . 

 presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “ cast 
 off . ” a minute or two later the skiff 's head was standing high up , 
 against the boat 's swell , and the voyage was begun . tom felt happy in 
 his success , for he knew it was the boat 's last trip for the night . at 
 the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped , and 
 tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk , landing fifty yards 
 downstream , out of danger of possible stragglers . 

 he flew along unfrequented alleys , and shortly found himself at his 
 aunt 's back fence . he climbed over , approached the “ ell , ” and looked 
 in at the sitting - room window , for a light was burning there . there 
 sat aunt polly , sid , mary , and joe harper 's mother , grouped together , 
 talking . they were by the bed , and the bed was between them and the 
 door . tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch ; then 
 he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack ; he continued pushing 
 cautiously , and quaking every time it creaked , till he judged he might 
 squeeze through on his knees ; so he put his head through and began , 
 warily . 

 “ what makes the candle blow so ? ” said aunt polly . tom hurried up . “ why , 
 that door 's open , i believe . why , of course it is . no end of strange 
 things now . go ' long and shut it , sid . ” 

 tom disappeared under the bed just in time . he lay and “ breathed ” 
  himself for a time , and then crept to where he could almost touch his 
 aunt 's foot . 

 “ but as i was saying , ” said aunt polly , “ he warn't _ bad _ , so to say -- only 
 misch_ee_vous . only just giddy , and harum - scarum , you know . he warn't 
 any more responsible than a colt . _ he _ never meant any harm , and he was 
 the best - hearted boy that ever was”--and she began to cry . 

 “ it was just so with my joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to 
 every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he 
 could be -- and laws bless me , to think i went and whipped him for taking 
 that cream , never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself because 
 it was sour , and i never to see him again in this world , never , never , 
 never , poor abused boy ! ” and mrs. harper sobbed as if her heart would 
 break . 

 “ i hope tom 's better off where he is , ” said sid , “ but if he 'd been 
 better in some ways-- ” 

 “ _ sid ! _ ” tom felt the glare of the old lady 's eye , though he could not 
 see it . “ not a word against my tom , now that he 's gone ! god'll take care 
 of _ him_--never you trouble _ your_self , sir ! oh , mrs. harper , i do n't 
 know how to give him up ! i do n't know how to give him up ! he was such a 
 comfort to me , although he tormented my old heart out of me , ' most . ” 

 “ the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away -- blessed be the name of 
 the lord ! but it 's so hard -- oh , it 's so hard ! only last saturday my joe 
 busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him sprawling . 
 little did i know then , how soon -- oh , if it was to do over again i 'd hug 
 him and bless him for it . ” 

 “ yes , yes , yes , i know just how you feel , mrs. harper , i know just 
 exactly how you feel . no longer ago than yesterday noon , my tom took 
 and filled the cat full of pain - killer , and i did think the cretur would 
 tear the house down . and god forgive me , i cracked tom 's head with my 
 thimble , poor boy , poor dead boy . but he 's out of all his troubles now . 
 and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach-- ” 

 but this memory was too much for the old lady , and she broke entirely 
 down . tom was snuffling , now , himself -- and more in pity of himself than 
 anybody else . he could hear mary crying , and putting in a kindly word 
 for him from time to time . he began to have a nobler opinion of himself 
 than ever before . still , he was sufficiently touched by his aunt 's grief 
 to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy -- and 
 the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his 
 nature , too , but he resisted and lay still . 

 he went on listening , and gathered by odds and ends that it was 
 conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim ; 
 then the small raft had been missed ; next , certain boys said the missing 
 lads had promised that the village should “ hear something ” soon ; the 
 wise - heads had “ put this and that together ” and decided that the lads 
 had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below , 
 presently ; but toward noon the raft had been found , lodged against the 
 missouri shore some five or six miles below the village -- and then hope 
 perished ; they must be drowned , else hunger would have driven them home 
 by nightfall if not sooner . it was believed that the search for the 
 bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must 
 have occurred in mid - channel , since the boys , being good swimmers , would 
 otherwise have escaped to shore . this was wednesday night . if the bodies 
 continued missing until sunday , all hope would be given over , and the 
 funerals would be preached on that morning . tom shuddered . 

 mrs. harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go . then with a 
 mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other 's 
 arms and had a good , consoling cry , and then parted . aunt polly was 
 tender far beyond her wo nt , in her goodnight to sid and mary . sid 
 snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart . 

 aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly , so appealingly , 
 and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice , 
 that he was weltering in tears again , long before she was through . 

 he had to keep still long after she went to bed , for she kept making 
 broken - hearted ejaculations from time to time , tossing unrestfully , and 
 turning over . but at last she was still , only moaning a little in her 
 sleep . now the boy stole out , rose gradually by the bedside , shaded the 
 candle - light with his hand , and stood regarding her . his heart was full 
 of pity for her . he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the 
 candle . but something occurred to him , and he lingered considering . 
 his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought ; he put the bark 
 hastily in his pocket . then he bent over and kissed the faded lips , and 
 straightway made his stealthy exit , latching the door behind him . 

 he threaded his way back to the ferry landing , found nobody at large 
 there , and walked boldly on board the boat , for he knew she was 
 tenantless except that there was a watchman , who always turned in and 
 slept like a graven image . he untied the skiff at the stern , slipped 
 into it , and was soon rowing cautiously upstream . when he had pulled a 
 mile above the village , he started quartering across and bent himself 
 stoutly to his work . he hit the landing on the other side neatly , for 
 this was a familiar bit of work to him . he was moved to capture 
 the skiff , arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore 
 legitimate prey for a pirate , but he knew a thorough search would be 
 made for it and that might end in revelations . so he stepped ashore and 
 entered the woods . 

 he sat down and took a long rest , torturing himself meanwhile to keep 
 awake , and then started warily down the home - stretch . the night was far 
 spent . it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the 
 island bar . he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the 
 great river with its splendor , and then he plunged into the stream . a 
 little later he paused , dripping , upon the threshold of the camp , and 
 heard joe say : 

 “ no , tom 's true - blue , huck , and he 'll come back . he wo n't desert . he 
 knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate , and tom 's too proud for that 
 sort of thing . he 's up to something or other . now i wonder what ? ” 

 “ well , the things is ours , anyway , ai n't they ? ” 

 “ pretty near , but not yet , huck . the writing says they are if he ai n't 
 back here to breakfast . ” 

 “ which he is ! ” exclaimed tom , with fine dramatic effect , stepping 
 grandly into camp . 

 a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided , and as the 
 boys set to work upon it , tom recounted ( and adorned ) his adventures . 
 they were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done . 
 then tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon , and the 
 other pirates got ready to fish and explore . 




 chapter xvi 

 after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar . 
 they went about poking sticks into the sand , and when they found a soft 
 place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands . sometimes 
 they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole . they were perfectly 
 round white things a trifle smaller than an english walnut . they had a 
 famous fried - egg feast that night , and another on friday morning . 

 after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar , and 
 chased each other round and round , shedding clothes as they went , until 
 they were naked , and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal 
 water of the bar , against the stiff current , which latter tripped their 
 legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun . 
 and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each 
 other 's faces with their palms , gradually approaching each other , with 
 averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays , and finally gripping and 
 struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor , and then they all 
 went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing , 
 sputtering , laughing , and gasping for breath at one and the same time . 

 when they were well exhausted , they would run out and sprawl on the dry , 
 hot sand , and lie there and cover themselves up with it , and by and by 
 break for the water again and go through the original performance once 
 more . finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented 
 flesh - colored “ tights ” very fairly ; so they drew a ring in the sand and 
 had a circus -- with three clowns in it , for none would yield this proudest 
 post to his neighbor . 

 next they got their marbles and played “ knucks ” and “ ringtaw ” and 
 “ keeps ” till that amusement grew stale . then joe and huck had another 
 swim , but tom would not venture , because he found that in kicking off 
 his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his 
 ankle , and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the 
 protection of this mysterious charm . he did not venture again until he 
 had found it , and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to 
 rest . they gradually wandered apart , dropped into the “ dumps , ” and 
 fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay 
 drowsing in the sun . tom found himself writing “ becky ” in the sand with 
 his big toe ; he scratched it out , and was angry with himself for his 
 weakness . but he wrote it again , nevertheless ; he could not help it . he 
 erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving 
 the other boys together and joining them . 

 but joe 's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection . he was so 
 homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it . the tears lay 
 very near the surface . huck was melancholy , too . tom was downhearted , 
 but tried hard not to show it . he had a secret which he was not ready 
 to tell , yet , but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon , he 
 would have to bring it out . he said , with a great show of cheerfulness : 

 “ i bet there 's been pirates on this island before , boys . we 'll explore 
 it again . they 've hid treasures here somewhere . how 'd you feel to light 
 on a rotten chest full of gold and silver -- hey ? ” 

 but it roused only faint enthusiasm , which faded out , with no reply . 
 tom tried one or two other seductions ; but they failed , too . it was 
 discouraging work . joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking 
 very gloomy . finally he said : 

 “ oh , boys , let 's give it up . i want to go home . it 's so lonesome . ” 

 “ oh no , joe , you 'll feel better by and by , ” said tom . “ just think of the 
 fishing that 's here . ” 

 “ i do n't care for fishing . i want to go home . ” 

 “ but , joe , there ai n't such another swimming - place anywhere . ” 

 “ swimming 's no good . i do n't seem to care for it , somehow , when there 
 ai n't anybody to say i sha'n't go in . i mean to go home . ” 

 “ oh , shucks ! baby ! you want to see your mother , i reckon . ” 

 “ yes , i _ do _ want to see my mother -- and you would , too , if you had one . i 
 ai n't any more baby than you are . ” and joe snuffled a little . 

 “ well , we 'll let the crybaby go home to his mother , wo n't we , huck ? poor 
 thing -- does it want to see its mother ? and so it shall . you like it here , 
 do n't you , huck ? we 'll stay , wo n't we ? ” 

 huck said , “ y - e - s”--without any heart in it . 

 “ i 'll never speak to you again as long as i live , ” said joe , rising . 
 “ there now ! ” and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself . 

 “ who cares ! ” said tom . “ nobody wants you to . go ' long home and get 
 laughed at . oh , you 're a nice pirate . huck and me ai n't crybabies . we 'll 
 stay , wo n't we , huck ? let him go if he wants to . i reckon we can get 
 along without him , per'aps . ” 

 but tom was uneasy , nevertheless , and was alarmed to see joe go sullenly 
 on with his dressing . and then it was discomforting to see huck eying 
 joe 's preparations so wistfully , and keeping up such an ominous silence . 
 presently , without a parting word , joe began to wade off toward the 
 illinois shore . tom 's heart began to sink . he glanced at huck . huck 
 could not bear the look , and dropped his eyes . then he said : 

 “ i want to go , too , tom . it was getting so lonesome anyway , and now 
 it 'll be worse . let 's us go , too , tom . ” 

 “ i wo n't ! you can all go , if you want to . i mean to stay . ” 

 “ tom , i better go . ” 

 “ well , go ' long -- who 's hendering you . ” 

 huck began to pick up his scattered clothes . he said : 

 “ tom , i wisht you 'd come , too . now you think it over . we 'll wait for you 
 when we get to shore . ” 

 “ well , you 'll wait a blame long time , that 's all . ” 

 huck started sorrowfully away , and tom stood looking after him , with a 
 strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along 
 too . he hoped the boys would stop , but they still waded slowly on . it 
 suddenly dawned on tom that it was become very lonely and still . he made 
 one final struggle with his pride , and then darted after his comrades , 
 yelling : 

 “ wait ! wait ! i want to tell you something ! ” 

 they presently stopped and turned around . when he got to where they 
 were , he began unfolding his secret , and they listened moodily till 
 at last they saw the “ point ” he was driving at , and then they set up a 
 warwhoop of applause and said it was “ splendid ! ” and said if he had 
 told them at first , they would n't have started away . he made a plausible 
 excuse ; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret 
 would keep them with him any very great length of time , and so he had 
 meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction . 

 the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will , 
 chattering all the time about tom 's stupendous plan and admiring the 
 genius of it . after a dainty egg and fish dinner , tom said he wanted to 
 learn to smoke , now . joe caught at the idea and said he would like to 
 try , too . so huck made pipes and filled them . these novices had never 
 smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine , and they “ bit ” the 
 tongue , and were not considered manly anyway . 

 now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff , 
 charily , and with slender confidence . the smoke had an unpleasant taste , 
 and they gagged a little , but tom said : 

 “ why , it 's just as easy ! if i 'd a knowed this was all , i 'd a learnt long 
 ago . ” 

 “ so would i , ” said joe . “ it 's just nothing . ” 

 “ why , many a time i 've looked at people smoking , and thought well i wish 
 i could do that ; but i never thought i could , ” said tom . 

 “ that 's just the way with me , hain't it , huck ? you 've heard me talk just 
 that way -- haven't you , huck ? i 'll leave it to huck if i have n't . ” 

 “ yes -- heaps of times , ” said huck . 

 “ well , i have too , ” said tom ; “ oh , hundreds of times . once down by the 
 slaughter - house . do n't you remember , huck ? bob tanner was there , and 
 johnny miller , and jeff thatcher , when i said it . do n't you remember , 
 huck , 'bout me saying that ? ” 

 “ yes , that 's so , ” said huck . “ that was the day after i lost a white 
 alley . no , ' twas the day before . ” 

 “ there -- i told you so , ” said tom . “ huck recollects it . ” 

 “ i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day , ” said joe . “ i do n't feel 
 sick . ” 

 “ neither do i , ” said tom . “ i could smoke it all day . but i bet you jeff 
 thatcher could n't . ” 

 “ jeff thatcher ! why , he 'd keel over just with two draws . just let him 
 try it once . _ he 'd _ see ! ” 

 “ i bet he would . and johnny miller -- i wish could see johnny miller tackle 
 it once . ” 

 “ oh , do n't i ! ” said joe . “ why , i bet you johnny miller could n't any more 
 do this than nothing . just one little snifter would fetch _ him_. ” 

 “ ' deed it would , joe . say -- i wish the boys could see us now . ” 

 “ so do i. ” 

 “ say -- boys , do n't say anything about it , and some time when they 're 
 around , i 'll come up to you and say , ' joe , got a pipe ? i want a smoke . ' 
 and you 'll say , kind of careless like , as if it warn't anything , you 'll 
 say , ' yes , i got my _ old _ pipe , and another one , but my tobacker ai n't 
 very good . ' and i 'll say , ' oh , that 's all right , if it 's _ strong _ 
 enough . ' and then you 'll out with the pipes , and we 'll light up just as 
 ca'm , and then just see 'em look ! ” 

 “ by jings , that 'll be gay , tom ! i wish it was _ now _ ! ” 

 “ so do i ! and when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating , 
 wo n't they wish they 'd been along ? ” 

 “ oh , i reckon not ! i 'll just _ bet _ they will ! ” 

 so the talk ran on . but presently it began to flag a trifle , and 
 grow disjointed . the silences widened ; the expectoration marvellously 
 increased . every pore inside the boys ' cheeks became a spouting 
 fountain ; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues 
 fast enough to prevent an inundation ; little overflowings down their 
 throats occurred in spite of all they could do , and sudden retchings 
 followed every time . both boys were looking very pale and miserable , 
 now . joe 's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers . tom 's followed . both 
 fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and 
 main . joe said feebly : 

 “ i 've lost my knife . i reckon i better go and find it . ” 

 tom said , with quivering lips and halting utterance : 

 “ i 'll help you . you go over that way and i 'll hunt around by the spring . 
 no , you need n't come , huck -- we can find it . ” 

 so huck sat down again , and waited an hour . then he found it lonesome , 
 and went to find his comrades . they were wide apart in the woods , both 
 very pale , both fast asleep . but something informed him that if they had 
 had any trouble they had got rid of it . 

 they were not talkative at supper that night . they had a humble look , 
 and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare 
 theirs , they said no , they were not feeling very well -- something they ate 
 at dinner had disagreed with them . 

 about midnight joe awoke , and called the boys . there was a brooding 
 oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something . the boys 
 huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of 
 the fire , though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was 
 stifling . they sat still , intent and waiting . the solemn hush continued . 
 beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the 
 blackness of darkness . presently there came a quivering glow that 
 vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished . by and by 
 another came , a little stronger . then another . then a faint moan came 
 sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting 
 breath upon their cheeks , and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit 
 of the night had gone by . there was a pause . now a weird flash turned 
 night into day and showed every little grassblade , separate and 
 distinct , that grew about their feet . and it showed three white , 
 startled faces , too . a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling 
 down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance . a 
 sweep of chilly air passed by , rustling all the leaves and snowing the 
 flaky ashes broadcast about the fire . another fierce glare lit up the 
 forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops 
 right over the boys ' heads . they clung together in terror , in the thick 
 gloom that followed . a few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves . 

 “ quick ! boys , go for the tent ! ” exclaimed tom . 

 they sprang away , stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark , no 
 two plunging in the same direction . a furious blast roared through 
 the trees , making everything sing as it went . one blinding flash after 
 another came , and peal on peal of deafening thunder . and now a drenching 
 rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the 
 ground . the boys cried out to each other , but the roaring wind and the 
 booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly . however , one by one 
 they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent , cold , scared , 
 and streaming with water ; but to have company in misery seemed something 
 to be grateful for . they could not talk , the old sail flapped so 
 furiously , even if the other noises would have allowed them . the tempest 
 rose higher and higher , and presently the sail tore loose from its 
 fastenings and went winging away on the blast . the boys seized each 
 others ' hands and fled , with many tumblings and bruises , to the shelter 
 of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank . now the battle was at its 
 highest . under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed 
 in the skies , everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless 
 distinctness : the bending trees , the billowy river , white with foam , the 
 driving spray of spumeflakes , the dim outlines of the high bluffs on 
 the other side , glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting 
 veil of rain . every little while some giant tree yielded the fight 
 and fell crashing through the younger growth ; and the unflagging 
 thunderpeals came now in ear - splitting explosive bursts , keen and sharp , 
 and unspeakably appalling . the storm culminated in one matchless effort 
 that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces , burn it up , drown it to 
 the treetops , blow it away , and deafen every creature in it , all at one 
 and the same moment . it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be 
 out in . 

 but at last the battle was done , and the forces retired with weaker and 
 weaker threatenings and grumblings , and peace resumed her sway . the 
 boys went back to camp , a good deal awed ; but they found there was still 
 something to be thankful for , because the great sycamore , the shelter 
 of their beds , was a ruin , now , blasted by the lightnings , and they were 
 not under it when the catastrophe happened . 

 everything in camp was drenched , the campfire as well ; for they were but 
 heedless lads , like their generation , and had made no provision against 
 rain . here was matter for dismay , for they were soaked through and 
 chilled . they were eloquent in their distress ; but they presently 
 discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had 
 been built against ( where it curved upward and separated itself from 
 the ground ) , that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting ; so they 
 patiently wrought until , with shreds and bark gathered from the under 
 sides of sheltered logs , they coaxed the fire to burn again . then they 
 piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace , and were 
 gladhearted once more . they dried their boiled ham and had a feast , 
 and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their 
 midnight adventure until morning , for there was not a dry spot to sleep 
 on , anywhere around . 

 as the sun began to steal in upon the boys , drowsiness came over 
 them , and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep . they got 
 scorched out by and by , and drearily set about getting breakfast . after 
 the meal they felt rusty , and stiff - jointed , and a little homesick once 
 more . tom saw the signs , and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as 
 he could . but they cared nothing for marbles , or circus , or swimming , or 
 anything . he reminded them of the imposing secret , and raised a ray of 
 cheer . while it lasted , he got them interested in a new device . this was 
 to knock off being pirates , for a while , and be indians for a change . 
 they were attracted by this idea ; so it was not long before they were 
 stripped , and striped from head to heel with black mud , like so many 
 zebras -- all of them chiefs , of course -- and then they went tearing through 
 the woods to attack an english settlement . 

 by and by they separated into three hostile tribes , and darted upon each 
 other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops , and killed and scalped each 
 other by thousands . it was a gory day . consequently it was an extremely 
 satisfactory one . 

 they assembled in camp toward suppertime , hungry and happy ; but now 
 a difficulty arose -- hostile indians could not break the bread of 
 hospitality together without first making peace , and this was a simple 
 impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace . there was no other 
 process that ever they had heard of . two of the savages almost wished 
 they had remained pirates . however , there was no other way ; so with such 
 show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and 
 took their whiff as it passed , in due form . 

 and behold , they were glad they had gone into savagery , for they had 
 gained something ; they found that they could now smoke a little without 
 having to go and hunt for a lost knife ; they did not get sick enough to 
 be seriously uncomfortable . they were not likely to fool away this high 
 promise for lack of effort . no , they practised cautiously , after supper , 
 with right fair success , and so they spent a jubilant evening . they were 
 prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been 
 in the scalping and skinning of the six nations . we will leave them to 
 smoke and chatter and brag , since we have no further use for them at 
 present . 




 chapter xvii 

 but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday 
 afternoon . the harpers , and aunt polly 's family , were being put into 
 mourning , with great grief and many tears . an unusual quiet possessed 
 the village , although it was ordinarily quiet enough , in all conscience . 
 the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air , and talked 
 little ; but they sighed often . the saturday holiday seemed a burden to 
 the children . they had no heart in their sports , and gradually gave them 
 up . 

 in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted 
 schoolhouse yard , and feeling very melancholy . but she found nothing 
 there to comfort her . she soliloquized : 

 “ oh , if i only had a brass andiron - knob again ! but i have n't got 
 anything now to remember him by . ” and she choked back a little sob . 

 presently she stopped , and said to herself : 

 “ it was right here . oh , if it was to do over again , i would n't say 
 that -- i would n't say it for the whole world . but he 's gone now ; i 'll 
 never , never , never see him any more . ” 

 this thought broke her down , and she wandered away , with tears rolling 
 down her cheeks . then quite a group of boys and girls -- playmates of tom 's 
 and joe's -- came by , and stood looking over the paling fence and talking 
 in reverent tones of how tom did so - and - so the last time they saw 
 him , and how joe said this and that small trifle ( pregnant with awful 
 prophecy , as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out 
 the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time , and then added 
 something like “ and i was a - standing just so -- just as i am now , and as if 
 you was him -- i was as close as that -- and he smiled , just this way -- and then 
 something seemed to go all over me , like -- awful , you know -- and i never 
 thought what it meant , of course , but i can see now ! ” 

 then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life , and 
 many claimed that dismal distinction , and offered evidences , more or 
 less tampered with by the witness ; and when it was ultimately decided 
 who _ did _ see the departed last , and exchanged the last words with them , 
 the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance , 
 and were gaped at and envied by all the rest . one poor chap , who had 
 no other grandeur to offer , said with tolerably manifest pride in the 
 remembrance : 

 “ well , tom sawyer he licked me once . ” 

 but that bid for glory was a failure . most of the boys could say that , 
 and so that cheapened the distinction too much . the group loitered away , 
 still recalling memories of the lost heroes , in awed voices . 

 when the sunday - school hour was finished , the next morning , the bell 
 began to toll , instead of ringing in the usual way . it was a very still 
 sabbath , and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush 
 that lay upon nature . the villagers began to gather , loitering a moment 
 in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event . but there 
 was no whispering in the house ; only the funereal rustling of dresses 
 as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there . none 
 could remember when the little church had been so full before . there 
 was finally a waiting pause , an expectant dumbness , and then aunt polly 
 entered , followed by sid and mary , and they by the harper family , all in 
 deep black , and the whole congregation , the old minister as well , rose 
 reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew . 
 there was another communing silence , broken at intervals by muffled 
 sobs , and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed . a moving 
 hymn was sung , and the text followed : “ i am the resurrection and the 
 life . ” 

 as the service proceeded , the clergyman drew such pictures of the 
 graces , the winning ways , and the rare promise of the lost lads that 
 every soul there , thinking he recognized these pictures , felt a pang 
 in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always 
 before , and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor 
 boys . the minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the 
 departed , too , which illustrated their sweet , generous natures , and the 
 people could easily see , now , how noble and beautiful those episodes 
 were , and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had 
 seemed rank rascalities , well deserving of the cowhide . the congregation 
 became more and more moved , as the pathetic tale went on , till at last 
 the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus 
 of anguished sobs , the preacher himself giving way to his feelings , and 
 crying in the pulpit . 

 there was a rustle in the gallery , which nobody noticed ; a moment later 
 the church door creaked ; the minister raised his streaming eyes above 
 his handkerchief , and stood transfixed ! first one and then another pair 
 of eyes followed the minister 's , and then almost with one impulse the 
 congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up 
 the aisle , tom in the lead , joe next , and huck , a ruin of drooping rags , 
 sneaking sheepishly in the rear ! they had been hid in the unused gallery 
 listening to their own funeral sermon ! 

 aunt polly , mary , and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored 
 ones , smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings , while 
 poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable , not knowing exactly what 
 to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes . he wavered , and 
 started to slink away , but tom seized him and said : 

 “ aunt polly , it ai n't fair . somebody 's got to be glad to see huck . ” 

 “ and so they shall . i 'm glad to see him , poor motherless thing ! ” and 
 the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing 
 capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before . 

 suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice : “ praise god from 
 whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it ! ” 

 and they did . old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst , and 
 while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the 
 envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the 
 proudest moment of his life . 

 as the “ sold ” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be 
 willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that 
 once more . 

 tom got more cuffs and kisses that day -- according to aunt polly 's varying 
 moods -- than he had earned before in a year ; and he hardly knew which 
 expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself . 




 chapter xviii 

 that was tom 's great secret -- the scheme to return home with his brother 
 pirates and attend their own funerals . they had paddled over to the 
 missouri shore on a log , at dusk on saturday , landing five or six miles 
 below the village ; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town 
 till nearly daylight , and had then crept through back lanes and alleys 
 and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of 
 invalided benches . 

 at breakfast , monday morning , aunt polly and mary were very loving to 
 tom , and very attentive to his wants . there was an unusual amount of 
 talk . in the course of it aunt polly said : 

 “ well , i do n't say it was n't a fine joke , tom , to keep everybody 
 suffering ' most a week so you boys had a good time , but it is a pity you 
 could be so hard - hearted as to let me suffer so . if you could come over 
 on a log to go to your funeral , you could have come over and give me a 
 hint some way that you warn't dead , but only run off . ” 

 “ yes , you could have done that , tom , ” said mary ; “ and i believe you 
 would if you had thought of it . ” 

 “ would you , tom ? ” said aunt polly , her face lighting wistfully . “ say , 
 now , would you , if you 'd thought of it ? ” 

 “ i -- well , i do n't know . ' twould ' a ' spoiled everything . ” 

 “ tom , i hoped you loved me that much , ” said aunt polly , with a grieved 
 tone that discomforted the boy . “ it would have been something if you 'd 
 cared enough to _ think _ of it , even if you did n't _ do _ it . ” 

 “ now , auntie , that ai n't any harm , ” pleaded mary ; “ it 's only tom 's giddy 
 way -- he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything . ” 

 “ more 's the pity . sid would have thought . and sid would have come and 
 _ done _ it , too . tom , you 'll look back , some day , when it 's too late , 
 and wish you 'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so 
 little . ” 

 “ now , auntie , you know i do care for you , ” said tom . 

 “ i 'd know it better if you acted more like it . ” 

 “ i wish now i 'd thought , ” said tom , with a repentant tone ; “ but i dreamt 
 about you , anyway . that 's something , ai n't it ? ” 

 “ it ai n't much -- a cat does that much -- but it 's better than nothing . what 
 did you dream ? ” 

 “ why , wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the 
 bed , and sid was sitting by the woodbox , and mary next to him . ” 

 “ well , so we did . so we always do . i 'm glad your dreams could take even 
 that much trouble about us . ” 

 “ and i dreamt that joe harper 's mother was here . ” 

 “ why , she was here ! did you dream any more ? ” 

 “ oh , lots . but it 's so dim , now . ” 

 “ well , try to recollect -- can't you ? ” 

 “ somehow it seems to me that the wind -- the wind blowed the -- the-- ” 

 “ try harder , tom ! the wind did blow something . come ! ” 

 tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute , and then 
 said : 

 “ i 've got it now ! i 've got it now ! it blowed the candle ! ” 

 “ mercy on us ! go on , tom -- go on ! ” 

 “ and it seems to me that you said , ' why , i believe that that door-- ' ” 

 “ go _ on _ , tom ! ” 

 “ just let me study a moment -- just a moment . oh , yes -- you said you believed 
 the door was open . ” 

 “ as i 'm sitting here , i did ! did n't i , mary ! go on ! ” 

 “ and then -- and then -- well i wo n't be certain , but it seems like as if you 
 made sid go and -- and-- ” 

 “ well ? well ? what did i make him do , tom ? what did i make him do ? ” 

 “ you made him -- you -- oh , you made him shut it . ” 

 “ well , for the land 's sake ! i never heard the beat of that in all my 
 days ! do n't tell _ me _ there ai n't anything in dreams , any more . sereny 
 harper shall know of this before i 'm an hour older . i 'd like to see her 
 get around _ this _ with her rubbage 'bout superstition . go on , tom ! ” 

 “ oh , it 's all getting just as bright as day , now . next you said i warn't 
 _ bad _ , only mischeevous and harum - scarum , and not any more responsible 
 than -- than -- i think it was a colt , or something . ” 

 “ and so it was ! well , goodness gracious ! go on , tom ! ” 

 “ and then you began to cry . ” 

 “ so i did . so i did . not the first time , neither . and then-- ” 

 “ then mrs. harper she began to cry , and said joe was just the same , and 
 she wished she had n't whipped him for taking cream when she 'd throwed it 
 out her own self-- ” 

 “ tom ! the sperrit was upon you ! you was a prophesying -- that 's what you 
 was doing ! land alive , go on , tom ! ” 

 “ then sid he said -- he said-- ” 

 “ i do n't think i said anything , ” said sid . 

 “ yes you did , sid , ” said mary . 

 “ shut your heads and let tom go on ! what did he say , tom ? ” 

 “ he said -- i _ think _ he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone 
 to , but if i 'd been better sometimes-- ” 

 “ _ there _ , d'you hear that ! it was his very words ! ” 

 “ and you shut him up sharp . ” 

 “ i lay i did ! there must ' a ' been an angel there . there _ was _ an angel 
 there , somewheres ! ” 

 “ and mrs. harper told about joe scaring her with a firecracker , and you 
 told about peter and the pain - killer-- ” 

 “ just as true as i live ! ” 

 “ and then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us , 
 and 'bout having the funeral sunday , and then you and old miss harper 
 hugged and cried , and she went . ” 

 “ it happened just so ! it happened just so , as sure as i 'm a - sitting in 
 these very tracks . tom , you could n't told it more like if you 'd ' a ' seen 
 it ! and then what ? go on , tom ! ” 

 “ then i thought you prayed for me -- and i could see you and hear every 
 word you said . and you went to bed , and i was so sorry that i took and 
 wrote on a piece of sycamore bark , ' we ai n't dead -- we are only off being 
 pirates , ' and put it on the table by the candle ; and then you looked 
 so good , laying there asleep , that i thought i went and leaned over and 
 kissed you on the lips . ” 

 “ did you , tom , _ did _ you ! i just forgive you everything for that ! ” and 
 she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the 
 guiltiest of villains . 

 “ it was very kind , even though it was only a -- dream , ” sid soliloquized 
 just audibly . 

 “ shut up , sid ! a body does just the same in a dream as he 'd do if he was 
 awake . here 's a big milum apple i 've been saving for you , tom , if you 
 was ever found again -- now go ' long to school . i 'm thankful to the good 
 god and father of us all i 've got you back , that 's long - suffering and 
 merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word , though goodness 
 knows i 'm unworthy of it , but if only the worthy ones got his blessings 
 and had his hand to help them over the rough places , there 's few enough 
 would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes . 
 go ' long sid , mary , tom -- take yourselves off -- you've hendered me long 
 enough . ” 

 the children left for school , and the old lady to call on mrs. harper 
 and vanquish her realism with tom 's marvellous dream . sid had better 
 judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the 
 house . it was this : “ pretty thin -- as long a dream as that , without any 
 mistakes in it ! ” 

 what a hero tom was become , now ! he did not go skipping and prancing , 
 but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the 
 public eye was on him . and indeed it was ; he tried not to seem to see 
 the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along , but they were food and 
 drink to him . smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels , as proud 
 to be seen with him , and tolerated by him , as if he had been the drummer 
 at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into 
 town . boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at 
 all ; but they were consuming with envy , nevertheless . they would have 
 given anything to have that swarthy sun - tanned skin of his , and his 
 glittering notoriety ; and tom would not have parted with either for a 
 circus . 

 at school the children made so much of him and of joe , and delivered 
 such eloquent admiration from their eyes , that the two heroes were 
 not long in becoming insufferably “ stuck - up . ” they began to tell their 
 adventures to hungry listeners -- but they only began ; it was not a 
 thing likely to have an end , with imaginations like theirs to furnish 
 material . and finally , when they got out their pipes and went serenely 
 puffing around , the very summit of glory was reached . 

 tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now . glory 
 was sufficient . he would live for glory . now that he was distinguished , 
 maybe she would be wanting to “ make up . ” well , let her -- she should see 
 that he could be as indifferent as some other people . presently she 
 arrived . tom pretended not to see her . he moved away and joined a group 
 of boys and girls and began to talk . soon he observed that she was 
 tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes , 
 pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates , and screaming with laughter 
 when she made a capture ; but he noticed that she always made her 
 captures in his vicinity , and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye 
 in his direction at such times , too . it gratified all the vicious vanity 
 that was in him ; and so , instead of winning him , it only “ set him up ” 
  the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he 
 knew she was about . presently she gave over skylarking , and moved 
 irresolutely about , sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and 
 wistfully toward tom . then she observed that now tom was talking more 
 particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else . she felt a sharp pang 
 and grew disturbed and uneasy at once . she tried to go away , but her 
 feet were treacherous , and carried her to the group instead . she said to 
 a girl almost at tom 's elbow -- with sham vivacity : 

 “ why , mary austin ! you bad girl , why did n't you come to sunday - school ? ” 

 “ i did come -- didn't you see me ? ” 

 “ why , no ! did you ? where did you sit ? ” 

 “ i was in miss peters ' class , where i always go . i saw _ you_. ” 

 “ did you ? why , it 's funny i did n't see you . i wanted to tell you about 
 the picnic . ” 

 “ oh , that 's jolly . who 's going to give it ? ” 

 “ my ma 's going to let me have one . ” 

 “ oh , goody ; i hope she 'll let _ me _ come . ” 

 “ well , she will . the picnic 's for me . she 'll let anybody come that i 
 want , and i want you . ” 

 “ that 's ever so nice . when is it going to be ? ” 

 “ by and by . maybe about vacation . ” 

 “ oh , wo n't it be fun ! you going to have all the girls and boys ? ” 

 “ yes , every one that 's friends to me -- or wants to be ” ; and she glanced 
 ever so furtively at tom , but he talked right along to amy lawrence 
 about the terrible storm on the island , and how the lightning tore the 
 great sycamore tree “ all to flinders ” while he was “ standing within 
 three feet of it . ” 

 “ oh , may i come ? ” said grace miller . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ and me ? ” said sally rogers . 

 “ yes . ” 

 “ and me , too ? ” said susy harper . “ and joe ? ” 

 “ yes . ” 

 and so on , with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged 
 for invitations but tom and amy . then tom turned coolly away , still 
 talking , and took amy with him . becky 's lips trembled and the tears 
 came to her eyes ; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on 
 chattering , but the life had gone out of the picnic , now , and out of 
 everything else ; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and 
 had what her sex call “ a good cry . ” then she sat moody , with wounded 
 pride , till the bell rang . she roused up , now , with a vindictive cast 
 in her eye , and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what 
 _ she 'd _ do . 

 at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant 
 self - satisfaction . and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate 
 her with the performance . at last he spied her , but there was a sudden 
 falling of his mercury . she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind 
 the schoolhouse looking at a picture - book with alfred temple -- and so 
 absorbed were they , and their heads so close together over the book , 
 that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides . 
 jealousy ran red - hot through tom 's veins . he began to hate himself for 
 throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation . he 
 called himself a fool , and all the hard names he could think of . he 
 wanted to cry with vexation . amy chatted happily along , as they walked , 
 for her heart was singing , but tom 's tongue had lost its function . he 
 did not hear what amy was saying , and whenever she paused expectantly 
 he could only stammer an awkward assent , which was as often misplaced 
 as otherwise . he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse , again and 
 again , to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there . he could 
 not help it . and it maddened him to see , as he thought he saw , that 
 becky thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the 
 living . but she did see , nevertheless ; and she knew she was winning her 
 fight , too , and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered . 

 amy 's happy prattle became intolerable . tom hinted at things he had 
 to attend to ; things that must be done ; and time was fleeting . but in 
 vain -- the girl chirped on . tom thought , “ oh , hang her , ai n't i ever going 
 to get rid of her ? ” at last he must be attending to those things -- and she 
 said artlessly that she would be “ around ” when school let out . and he 
 hastened away , hating her for it . 

 “ any other boy ! ” tom thought , grating his teeth . “ any boy in the whole 
 town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is 
 aristocracy ! oh , all right , i licked you the first day you ever saw this 
 town , mister , and i 'll lick you again ! you just wait till i catch you 
 out ! i 'll just take and-- ” 

 and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy -- pummelling 
 the air , and kicking and gouging . “ oh , you do , do you ? you holler 
 ' nough , do you ? now , then , let that learn you ! ” and so the imaginary 
 flogging was finished to his satisfaction . 

 tom fled home at noon . his conscience could not endure any more of amy 's 
 grateful happiness , and his jealousy could bear no more of the other 
 distress . becky resumed her picture inspections with alfred , but as the 
 minutes dragged along and no tom came to suffer , her triumph began to 
 cloud and she lost interest ; gravity and absentmindedness followed , 
 and then melancholy ; two or three times she pricked up her ear at 
 a footstep , but it was a false hope ; no tom came . at last she grew 
 entirely miserable and wished she had n't carried it so far . when 
 poor alfred , seeing that he was losing her , he did not know how , kept 
 exclaiming : “ oh , here 's a jolly one ! look at this ! ” she lost patience at 
 last , and said , “ oh , do n't bother me ! i do n't care for them ! ” and burst 
 into tears , and got up and walked away . 

 alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her , but she 
 said : 

 “ go away and leave me alone , ca n't you ! i hate you ! ” 

 so the boy halted , wondering what he could have done -- for she had said 
 she would look at pictures all through the nooning -- and she walked on , 
 crying . then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse . he was 
 humiliated and angry . he easily guessed his way to the truth -- the girl 
 had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer . 
 he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him . 
 he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much 
 risk to himself . tom 's spelling - book fell under his eye . here was his 
 opportunity . he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and 
 poured ink upon the page . 

 becky , glancing in at a window behind him at the moment , saw the act , 
 and moved on , without discovering herself . she started homeward , now , 
 intending to find tom and tell him ; tom would be thankful and their 
 troubles would be healed . before she was half way home , however , she 
 had changed her mind . the thought of tom 's treatment of her when she was 
 talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame . 
 she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling - book 's 
 account , and to hate him forever , into the bargain . 




 chapter xix 

 tom arrived at home in a dreary mood , and the first thing his aunt said 
 to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising 
 market : 

 “ tom , i 've a notion to skin you alive ! ” 

 “ auntie , what have i done ? ” 

 “ well , you 've done enough . here i go over to sereny harper , like an old 
 softy , expecting i 'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about 
 that dream , when lo and behold you she 'd found out from joe that you was 
 over here and heard all the talk we had that night . tom , i do n't know 
 what is to become of a boy that will act like that . it makes me feel so 
 bad to think you could let me go to sereny harper and make such a fool 
 of myself and never say a word . ” 

 this was a new aspect of the thing . his smartness of the morning had 
 seemed to tom a good joke before , and very ingenious . it merely looked 
 mean and shabby now . he hung his head and could not think of anything to 
 say for a moment . then he said : 

 “ auntie , i wish i had n't done it -- but i did n't think . ” 

 “ oh , child , you never think . you never think of anything but your 
 own selfishness . you could think to come all the way over here from 
 jackson 's island in the night to laugh at our troubles , and you could 
 think to fool me with a lie about a dream ; but you could n't ever think 
 to pity us and save us from sorrow . ” 

 “ auntie , i know now it was mean , but i did n't mean to be mean . i did n't , 
 honest . and besides , i did n't come over here to laugh at you that 
 night . ” 

 “ what did you come for , then ? ” 

 “ it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us , because we had n't got 
 drownded . ” 

 “ tom , tom , i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could 
 believe you ever had as good a thought as that , but you know you never 
 did -- and i know it , tom . ” 

 “ indeed and ' deed i did , auntie -- i wish i may never stir if i did n't . ” 

 “ oh , tom , do n't lie -- don't do it . it only makes things a hundred times 
 worse . ” 

 “ it ai n't a lie , auntie ; it 's the truth . i wanted to keep you from 
 grieving -- that was all that made me come . ” 

 “ i 'd give the whole world to believe that -- it would cover up a power 
 of sins , tom . i 'd ' most be glad you 'd run off and acted so bad . but it 
 ai n't reasonable ; because , why did n't you tell me , child ? ” 

 “ why , you see , when you got to talking about the funeral , i just got all 
 full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church , and i could n't 
 somehow bear to spoil it . so i just put the bark back in my pocket and 
 kept mum . ” 

 “ what bark ? ” 

 “ the bark i had wrote on to tell you we 'd gone pirating . i wish , now , 
 you 'd waked up when i kissed you -- i do , honest . ” 

 the hard lines in his aunt 's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned 
 in her eyes . 

 “ _ did _ you kiss me , tom ? ” 

 “ why , yes , i did . ” 

 “ are you sure you did , tom ? ” 

 “ why , yes , i did , auntie -- certain sure . ” 

 “ what did you kiss me for , tom ? ” 

 “ because i loved you so , and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry . ” 

 the words sounded like truth . the old lady could not hide a tremor in 
 her voice when she said : 

 “ kiss me again , tom!--and be off with you to school , now , and do n't 
 bother me any more . ” 

 the moment he was gone , she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a 
 jacket which tom had gone pirating in . then she stopped , with it in her 
 hand , and said to herself : 

 “ no , i do n't dare . poor boy , i reckon he 's lied about it -- but it 's a 
 blessed , blessed lie , there 's such a comfort come from it . i hope 
 the lord -- i _ know _ the lord will forgive him , because it was such 
 good - heartedness in him to tell it . but i do n't want to find out it 's a 
 lie . i wo n't look . ” 

 she put the jacket away , and stood by musing a minute . twice she put out 
 her hand to take the garment again , and twice she refrained . once more 
 she ventured , and this time she fortified herself with the thought : 
 “ it 's a good lie -- it 's a good lie -- i wo n't let it grieve me . ” so she 
 sought the jacket pocket . a moment later she was reading tom 's piece of 
 bark through flowing tears and saying : “ i could forgive the boy , now , if 
 he 'd committed a million sins ! ” 




 chapter xx 

 there was something about aunt polly 's manner , when she kissed tom , that 
 swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again . he 
 started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky thatcher at the 
 head of meadow lane . his mood always determined his manner . without a 
 moment 's hesitation he ran to her and said : 

 “ i acted mighty mean today , becky , and i 'm so sorry . i wo n't ever , ever 
 do that way again , as long as ever i live -- please make up , wo n't you ? ” 

 the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face : 

 “ i 'll thank you to keep yourself _ to _ yourself , mr. thomas sawyer . i 'll 
 never speak to you again . ” 

 she tossed her head and passed on . tom was so stunned that he had not 
 even presence of mind enough to say “ who cares , miss smarty ? ” until the 
 right time to say it had gone by . so he said nothing . but he was in a 
 fine rage , nevertheless . he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were 
 a boy , and imagining how he would trounce her if she were . he presently 
 encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed . she hurled 
 one in return , and the angry breach was complete . it seemed to becky , in 
 her hot resentment , that she could hardly wait for school to “ take in , ” 
  she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spelling - book . 
 if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple , tom 's 
 offensive fling had driven it entirely away . 

 poor girl , she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself . 
 the master , mr. dobbins , had reached middle age with an unsatisfied 
 ambition . the darling of his desires was , to be a doctor , but 
 poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village 
 schoolmaster . every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and 
 absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting . he kept 
 that book under lock and key . there was not an urchin in school but was 
 perishing to have a glimpse of it , but the chance never came . every boy 
 and girl had a theory about the nature of that book ; but no two theories 
 were alike , and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case . 
 now , as becky was passing by the desk , which stood near the door , she 
 noticed that the key was in the lock ! it was a precious moment . she 
 glanced around ; found herself alone , and the next instant she had the 
 book in her hands . the titlepage -- professor somebody 's _ anatomy_--carried 
 no information to her mind ; so she began to turn the leaves . she came at 
 once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece -- a human figure , 
 stark naked . at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom sawyer 
 stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture . becky 
 snatched at the book to close it , and had the hard luck to tear the 
 pictured page half down the middle . she thrust the volume into the desk , 
 turned the key , and burst out crying with shame and vexation . 

 “ tom sawyer , you are just as mean as you can be , to sneak up on a person 
 and look at what they 're looking at . ” 

 “ how could i know you was looking at anything ? ” 

 “ you ought to be ashamed of yourself , tom sawyer ; you know you 're 
 going to tell on me , and oh , what shall i do , what shall i do ! i 'll be 
 whipped , and i never was whipped in school . ” 

 then she stamped her little foot and said : 

 “ _ be _ so mean if you want to ! i know something that 's going to happen . 
 you just wait and you 'll see ! hateful , hateful , hateful!”--and she flung 
 out of the house with a new explosion of crying . 

 tom stood still , rather flustered by this onslaught . presently he said 
 to himself : 

 “ what a curious kind of a fool a girl is ! never been licked in 
 school ! shucks ! what 's a licking ! that 's just like a girl -- they're so 
 thin - skinned and chicken - hearted . well , of course i ai n't going to tell 
 old dobbins on this little fool , because there 's other ways of getting 
 even on her , that ai n't so mean ; but what of it ? old dobbins will ask 
 who it was tore his book . nobody'll answer . then he 'll do just the way 
 he always does -- ask first one and then t'other , and when he comes to the 
 right girl he 'll know it , without any telling . girls ' faces always tell 
 on them . they ai n't got any backbone . she 'll get licked . well , it 's a 
 kind of a tight place for becky thatcher , because there ai n't any way 
 out of it . ” tom conned the thing a moment longer , and then added : “ all 
 right , though ; she 'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her sweat it 
 out ! ” 

 tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside . in a few moments the 
 master arrived and school “ took in . ” tom did not feel a strong interest 
 in his studies . every time he stole a glance at the girls ' side of the 
 room becky 's face troubled him . considering all things , he did not want 
 to pity her , and yet it was all he could do to help it . he could get 
 up no exultation that was really worthy the name . presently the 
 spelling - book discovery was made , and tom 's mind was entirely full 
 of his own matters for a while after that . becky roused up from her 
 lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings . she 
 did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he 
 spilt the ink on the book himself ; and she was right . the denial only 
 seemed to make the thing worse for tom . becky supposed she would be glad 
 of that , and she tried to believe she was glad of it , but she found she 
 was not certain . when the worst came to the worst , she had an impulse 
 to get up and tell on alfred temple , but she made an effort and forced 
 herself to keep still -- because , said she to herself , “ he 'll tell about me 
 tearing the picture sure . i would n't say a word , not to save his life ! ” 

 tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all 
 broken - hearted , for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly 
 upset the ink on the spelling - book himself , in some skylarking bout -- he 
 had denied it for form 's sake and because it was custom , and had stuck 
 to the denial from principle . 

 a whole hour drifted by , the master sat nodding in his throne , the air 
 was drowsy with the hum of study . by and by , mr. dobbins straightened 
 himself up , yawned , then unlocked his desk , and reached for his book , 
 but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it . most of the 
 pupils glanced up languidly , but there were two among them that watched 
 his movements with intent eyes . mr. dobbins fingered his book absently 
 for a while , then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read ! 
 tom shot a glance at becky . he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit 
 look as she did , with a gun levelled at its head . instantly he forgot 
 his quarrel with her . quick -- something must be done ! done in a flash , 
 too ! but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention . 
 good!--he had an inspiration ! he would run and snatch the book , spring 
 through the door and fly . but his resolution shook for one little 
 instant , and the chance was lost -- the master opened the volume . if tom 
 only had the wasted opportunity back again ! too late . there was no help 
 for becky now , he said . the next moment the master faced the school . 
 every eye sank under his gaze . there was that in it which smote even 
 the innocent with fear . there was silence while one might count ten -- the 
 master was gathering his wrath . then he spoke : “ who tore this book ? ” 

 there was not a sound . one could have heard a pin drop . the stillness 
 continued ; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt . 

 “ benjamin rogers , did you tear this book ? ” 

 a denial . another pause . 

 “ joseph harper , did you ? ” 

 another denial . tom 's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the 
 slow torture of these proceedings . the master scanned the ranks of 
 boys -- considered a while , then turned to the girls : 

 “ amy lawrence ? ” 

 a shake of the head . 

 “ gracie miller ? ” 

 the same sign . 

 “ susan harper , did you do this ? ” 

 another negative . the next girl was becky thatcher . tom was trembling 
 from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the 
 situation . 

 “ rebecca thatcher ” [ tom glanced at her face -- it was white with 
 terror]--“did you tear -- no , look me in the face ” [ her hands rose in 
 appeal]--“did you tear this book ? ” 

 a thought shot like lightning through tom 's brain . he sprang to his feet 
 and shouted--“i done it ! ” 

 the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly . tom stood a 
 moment , to gather his dismembered faculties ; and when he stepped forward 
 to go to his punishment the surprise , the gratitude , the adoration that 
 shone upon him out of poor becky 's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred 
 floggings . inspired by the splendor of his own act , he took without 
 an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr. dobbins had ever 
 administered ; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a 
 command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed -- for he 
 knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done , and not 
 count the tedious time as loss , either . 

 tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple ; for 
 with shame and repentance becky had told him all , not forgetting her own 
 treachery ; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way , soon , to 
 pleasanter musings , and he fell asleep at last with becky 's latest words 
 lingering dreamily in his ear-- 

 “ tom , how _ could _ you be so noble ! ” 




 chapter xxi 

 vacation was approaching . the schoolmaster , always severe , grew severer 
 and more exacting than ever , for he wanted the school to make a good 
 showing on “ examination ” day . his rod and his ferule were seldom idle 
 now -- at least among the smaller pupils . only the biggest boys , and young 
 ladies of eighteen and twenty , escaped lashing . mr. dobbins ' lashings 
 were very vigorous ones , too ; for although he carried , under his wig , a 
 perfectly bald and shiny head , he had only reached middle age , and there 
 was no sign of feebleness in his muscle . as the great day approached , 
 all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface ; he seemed to take a 
 vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings . the consequence 
 was , that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and 
 their nights in plotting revenge . they threw away no opportunity to do 
 the master a mischief . but he kept ahead all the time . the retribution 
 that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that 
 the boys always retired from the field badly worsted . at last they 
 conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory . 
 they swore in the signpainter 's boy , told him the scheme , and asked his 
 help . he had his own reasons for being delighted , for the master boarded 
 in his father 's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him . 
 the master 's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days , and 
 there would be nothing to interfere with the plan ; the master always 
 prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled , and 
 the signpainter 's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper 
 condition on examination evening he would “ manage the thing ” while he 
 napped in his chair ; then he would have him awakened at the right time 
 and hurried away to school . 

 in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived . at eight in 
 the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted , and adorned with 
 wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers . the master sat throned in 
 his great chair upon a raised platform , with his blackboard behind him . 
 he was looking tolerably mellow . three rows of benches on each side and 
 six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town 
 and by the parents of the pupils . to his left , back of the rows of 
 citizens , was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the 
 scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening ; rows of 
 small boys , washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort ; 
 rows of gawky big boys ; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in 
 lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms , their 
 grandmothers ' ancient trinkets , their bits of pink and blue ribbon and 
 the flowers in their hair . all the rest of the house was filled with 
 non - participating scholars . 

 the exercises began . a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited , 
 “ you 'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage , ” 
  etc .-- accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic 
 gestures which a machine might have used -- supposing the machine to be a 
 trifle out of order . but he got through safely , though cruelly scared , 
 and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and 
 retired . 

 a little shamefaced girl lisped , “ mary had a little lamb , ” etc . , 
 performed a compassion - inspiring curtsy , got her meed of applause , and 
 sat down flushed and happy . 

 tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into 
 the unquenchable and indestructible “ give me liberty or give me death ” 
  speech , with fine fury and frantic gesticulation , and broke down in the 
 middle of it . a ghastly stage - fright seized him , his legs quaked under 
 him and he was like to choke . true , he had the manifest sympathy of the 
 house but he had the house 's silence , too , which was even worse than 
 its sympathy . the master frowned , and this completed the disaster . tom 
 struggled awhile and then retired , utterly defeated . there was a weak 
 attempt at applause , but it died early . 

 “ the boy stood on the burning deck ” followed ; also “ the assyrian came 
 down , ” and other declamatory gems . then there were reading exercises , 
 and a spelling fight . the meagre latin class recited with honor . the 
 prime feature of the evening was in order , now -- original “ compositions ” 
  by the young ladies . each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the 
 platform , cleared her throat , held up her manuscript ( tied with dainty 
 ribbon ) , and proceeded to read , with labored attention to “ expression ” 
  and punctuation . the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon 
 similar occasions by their mothers before them , their grandmothers , 
 and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the 
 crusades . “ friendship ” was one ; “ memories of other days ” ; “ religion in 
 history ” ; “ dream land ” ; “ the advantages of culture ” ; “ forms of political 
 government compared and contrasted ” ; “ melancholy ” ; “ filial love ” ; “ heart 
 longings , ” etc . , etc . 

 a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted 
 melancholy ; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “ fine language ” ; 
 another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words 
 and phrases until they were worn entirely out ; and a peculiarity that 
 conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable 
 sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one 
 of them . no matter what the subject might be , a brainracking effort was 
 made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious 
 mind could contemplate with edification . the glaring insincerity of 
 these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the 
 fashion from the schools , and it is not sufficient today ; it never will 
 be sufficient while the world stands , perhaps . there is no school in 
 all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their 
 compositions with a sermon ; and you will find that the sermon of the 
 most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always 
 the longest and the most relentlessly pious . but enough of this . homely 
 truth is unpalatable . 

 let us return to the “ examination . ” the first composition that was read 
 was one entitled “ is this , then , life ? ” perhaps the reader can endure an 
 extract from it : 

 “ in the common walks of life , with what delightful emotions does the 
 youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity ! 
 imagination is busy sketching rose - tinted pictures of joy . in fancy , the 
 voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng , ' the 
 observed of all observers . ' her graceful form , arrayed in snowy robes , 
 is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance ; her eye is brightest , 
 her step is lightest in the gay assembly . 

 “ in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by , and the welcome hour 
 arrives for her entrance into the elysian world , of which she has 
 had such bright dreams . how fairy - like does everything appear to her 
 enchanted vision ! each new scene is more charming than the last . but 
 after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior , all is 
 vanity , the flattery which once charmed her soul , now grates harshly 
 upon her ear ; the ballroom has lost its charms ; and with wasted health 
 and imbittered heart , she turns away with the conviction that earthly 
 pleasures can not satisfy the longings of the soul ! ” 

 and so forth and so on . there was a buzz of gratification from time to 
 time during the reading , accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “ how 
 sweet ! ” “ how eloquent ! ” “ so true ! ” etc . , and after the thing had closed 
 with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic . 

 then arose a slim , melancholy girl , whose face had the “ interesting ” 
  paleness that comes of pills and indigestion , and read a “ poem . ” two 
 stanzas of it will do : 

 “ a missouri maiden 's farewell to alabama 

 “ alabama , goodbye ! i love thee well ! but yet for a while do i leave thee 
 now ! sad , yes , sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell , and burning 
 recollections throng my brow ! for i have wandered through thy flowery 
 woods ; have roamed and read near tallapoosa 's stream ; have listened to 
 tallassee 's warring floods , and wooed on coosa 's side aurora 's beam . 

 “ yet shame i not to bear an o'erfull heart , nor blush to turn behind 
 my tearful eyes ; ' tis from no stranger land i now must part , ' tis to no 
 strangers left i yield these sighs . welcome and home were mine within 
 this state , whose vales i leave -- whose spires fade fast from me and cold 
 must be mine eyes , and heart , and tete , when , dear alabama ! they turn 
 cold on thee ! ” there were very few there who knew what “ tete ” meant , but 
 the poem was very satisfactory , nevertheless . 

 next appeared a dark - complexioned , black - eyed , black - haired young lady , 
 who paused an impressive moment , assumed a tragic expression , and began 
 to read in a measured , solemn tone : 

 “ a vision 

 “ dark and tempestuous was night . around the throne on high not a single 
 star quivered ; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly 
 vibrated upon the ear ; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry 
 mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven , seeming to scorn the power 
 exerted over its terror by the illustrious franklin ! even the boisterous 
 winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes , and blustered 
 about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene . 

 “ at such a time , so dark , so dreary , for human sympathy my very spirit 
 sighed ; but instead thereof , 

 “ ' my dearest friend , my counsellor , my comforter and guide -- my joy in 
 grief , my second bliss in joy , ' came to my side . she moved like one of 
 those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy 's eden by 
 the romantic and young , a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own 
 transcendent loveliness . so soft was her step , it failed to make even a 
 sound , and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch , 
 as other unobtrusive beauties , she would have glided away 
 unperceived -- unsought . a strange sadness rested upon her features , like 
 icy tears upon the robe of december , as she pointed to the contending 
 elements without , and bade me contemplate the two beings presented . ” 

 this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a 
 sermon so destructive of all hope to non - presbyterians that it took 
 the first prize . this composition was considered to be the very finest 
 effort of the evening . the mayor of the village , in delivering the prize 
 to the author of it , made a warm speech in which he said that it was by 
 far the most “ eloquent ” thing he had ever listened to , and that daniel 
 webster himself might well be proud of it . 

 it may be remarked , in passing , that the number of compositions in which 
 the word “ beauteous ” was over - fondled , and human experience referred to 
 as “ life 's page , ” was up to the usual average . 

 now the master , mellow almost to the verge of geniality , put his chair 
 aside , turned his back to the audience , and began to draw a map of 
 america on the blackboard , to exercise the geography class upon . but he 
 made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand , and a smothered titter 
 rippled over the house . he knew what the matter was , and set himself to 
 right it . he sponged out lines and remade them ; but he only distorted 
 them more than ever , and the tittering was more pronounced . he threw his 
 entire attention upon his work , now , as if determined not to be put down 
 by the mirth . he felt that all eyes were fastened upon him ; he imagined 
 he was succeeding , and yet the tittering continued ; it even manifestly 
 increased . and well it might . there was a garret above , pierced with 
 a scuttle over his head ; and down through this scuttle came a cat , 
 suspended around the haunches by a string ; she had a rag tied about 
 her head and jaws to keep her from mewing ; as she slowly descended she 
 curved upward and clawed at the string , she swung downward and clawed 
 at the intangible air . the tittering rose higher and higher -- the cat was 
 within six inches of the absorbed teacher 's head -- down , down , a little 
 lower , and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws , clung to it , 
 and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still 
 in her possession ! and how the light did blaze abroad from the master 's 
 bald pate -- for the signpainter 's boy had _ gilded _ it ! 

 that broke up the meeting . the boys were avenged . vacation had come . 

 note :-- the pretended “ compositions ” quoted in this chapter are taken 
 without alteration from a volume entitled “ prose and poetry , by a 
 western lady”--but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl 
 pattern , and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be . 




 chapter xxii 

 tom joined the new order of cadets of temperance , being attracted by the 
 showy character of their “ regalia . ” he promised to abstain from smoking , 
 chewing , and profanity as long as he remained a member . now he found out 
 a new thing -- namely , that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way 
 in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing . tom soon 
 found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear ; the desire 
 grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display 
 himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order . fourth 
 of july was coming ; but he soon gave that up -- gave it up before he had 
 worn his shackles over forty - eight hours -- and fixed his hopes upon old 
 judge frazer , justice of the peace , who was apparently on his deathbed 
 and would have a big public funeral , since he was so high an official . 
 during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judge 's condition 
 and hungry for news of it . sometimes his hopes ran high -- so high that 
 he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the 
 looking - glass . but the judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating . 
 at last he was pronounced upon the mend -- and then convalescent . tom was 
 disgusted ; and felt a sense of injury , too . he handed in his resignation 
 at once -- and that night the judge suffered a relapse and died . tom 
 resolved that he would never trust a man like that again . 

 the funeral was a fine thing . the cadets paraded in a style calculated 
 to kill the late member with envy . tom was a free boy again , 
 however -- there was something in that . he could drink and swear , now -- but 
 found to his surprise that he did not want to . the simple fact that he 
 could , took the desire away , and the charm of it . 

 tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning 
 to hang a little heavily on his hands . 

 he attempted a diary -- but nothing happened during three days , and so he 
 abandoned it . 

 the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town , and made a 
 sensation . tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were happy 
 for two days . 

 even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure , for it rained 
 hard , there was no procession in consequence , and the greatest man 
 in the world ( as tom supposed ) , mr. benton , an actual united states 
 senator , proved an overwhelming disappointment -- for he was not 
 twenty - five feet high , nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it . 

 a circus came . the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents 
 made of rag carpeting -- admission , three pins for boys , two for girls -- and 
 then circusing was abandoned . 

 a phrenologist and a mesmerizer came -- and went again and left the village 
 duller and drearier than ever . 

 there were some boys - and - girls ' parties , but they were so few and so 
 delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder . 

 becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her 
 parents during vacation -- so there was no bright side to life anywhere . 

 the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery . it was a very 
 cancer for permanency and pain . 

 then came the measles . 

 during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner , dead to the world and its 
 happenings . he was very ill , he was interested in nothing . when he got 
 upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown , a melancholy change had 
 come over everything and every creature . there had been a “ revival , ” and 
 everybody had “ got religion , ” not only the adults , but even the boys and 
 girls . tom went about , hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed 
 sinful face , but disappointment crossed him everywhere . he found joe 
 harper studying a testament , and turned sadly away from the depressing 
 spectacle . he sought ben rogers , and found him visiting the poor with a 
 basket of tracts . he hunted up jim hollis , who called his attention to 
 the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning . every boy 
 he encountered added another ton to his depression ; and when , in 
 desperation , he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn 
 and was received with a scriptural quotation , his heart broke and he 
 crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost , 
 forever and forever . 

 and that night there came on a terrific storm , with driving rain , awful 
 claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning . he covered his head 
 with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom ; for 
 he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him . 
 he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the 
 extremity of endurance and that this was the result . it might have 
 seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a 
 battery of artillery , but there seemed nothing incongruous about the 
 getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from 
 under an insect like himself . 

 by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its 
 object . the boy 's first impulse was to be grateful , and reform . his 
 second was to wait -- for there might not be any more storms . 

 the next day the doctors were back ; tom had relapsed . the three weeks he 
 spent on his back this time seemed an entire age . when he got abroad 
 at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared , remembering how 
 lonely was his estate , how companionless and forlorn he was . he drifted 
 listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a 
 juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder , in the presence of her 
 victim , a bird . he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a 
 stolen melon . poor lads ! they -- like tom -- had suffered a relapse . 




 chapter xxiii 

 at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred -- and vigorously : the murder 
 trial came on in the court . it became the absorbing topic of village 
 talk immediately . tom could not get away from it . every reference to 
 the murder sent a shudder to his heart , for his troubled conscience 
 and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in 
 his hearing as “ feelers ” ; he did not see how he could be suspected of 
 knowing anything about the murder , but still he could not be comfortable 
 in the midst of this gossip . it kept him in a cold shiver all the time . 
 he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him . it would be some 
 relief to unseal his tongue for a little while ; to divide his burden of 
 distress with another sufferer . moreover , he wanted to assure himself 
 that huck had remained discreet . 

 “ huck , have you ever told anybody about -- that ? ” 

 “ ' bout what ? ” 

 “ you know what . ” 

 “ oh--'course i have n't . ” 

 “ never a word ? ” 

 “ never a solitary word , so help me . what makes you ask ? ” 

 “ well , i was afeard . ” 

 “ why , tom sawyer , we would n't be alive two days if that got found out . 
 _ you _ know that . ” 

 tom felt more comfortable . after a pause : 

 “ huck , they could n't anybody get you to tell , could they ? ” 

 “ get me to tell ? why , if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they 
 could get me to tell . they ai n't no different way . ” 

 “ well , that 's all right , then . i reckon we 're safe as long as we keep 
 mum . but let 's swear again , anyway . it 's more surer . ” 

 “ i 'm agreed . ” 

 so they swore again with dread solemnities . 

 “ what is the talk around , huck ? i 've heard a power of it . ” 

 “ talk ? well , it 's just muff potter , muff potter , muff potter all the 
 time . it keeps me in a sweat , constant , so 's i want to hide som'ers . ” 

 “ that 's just the same way they go on round me . i reckon he 's a goner . 
 do n't you feel sorry for him , sometimes ? ” 

 “ most always -- most always . he ai n't no account ; but then he hain't ever 
 done anything to hurt anybody . just fishes a little , to get money to 
 get drunk on -- and loafs around considerable ; but lord , we all do 
 that -- leastways most of us -- preachers and such like . but he 's kind of 
 good -- he give me half a fish , once , when there warn't enough for two ; and 
 lots of times he 's kind of stood by me when i was out of luck . ” 

 “ well , he 's mended kites for me , huck , and knitted hooks on to my line . 
 i wish we could get him out of there . ” 

 “ my ! we could n't get him out , tom . and besides , ' twouldn't do any good ; 
 they 'd ketch him again . ” 

 “ yes -- so they would . but i hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens 
 when he never done -- that . ” 

 “ i do too , tom . lord , i hear 'em say he 's the bloodiest looking villain 
 in this country , and they wonder he was n't ever hung before . ” 

 “ yes , they talk like that , all the time . i 've heard 'em say that if he 
 was to get free they 'd lynch him . ” 

 “ and they 'd do it , too . ” 

 the boys had a long talk , but it brought them little comfort . as the 
 twilight drew on , they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood 
 of the little isolated jail , perhaps with an undefined hope that 
 something would happen that might clear away their difficulties . but 
 nothing happened ; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in 
 this luckless captive . 

 the boys did as they had often done before -- went to the cell grating and 
 gave potter some tobacco and matches . he was on the ground floor and 
 there were no guards . 

 his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences 
 before -- it cut deeper than ever , this time . they felt cowardly and 
 treacherous to the last degree when potter said : 

 “ you 've been mighty good to me , boys -- better'n anybody else in this town . 
 and i do n't forget it , i do n't . often i says to myself , says i , ' i used 
 to mend all the boys ' kites and things , and show 'em where the good 
 fishin ' places was , and befriend 'em what i could , and now they 've 
 all forgot old muff when he 's in trouble ; but tom do n't , and huck 
 don't--_they _ do n't forget him , says i , ' and i do n't forget them . ' well , 
 boys , i done an awful thing -- drunk and crazy at the time -- that 's the only 
 way i account for it -- and now i got to swing for it , and it 's right . 
 right , and _ best _ , too , i reckon -- hope so , anyway . well , we wo n't talk 
 about that . i do n't want to make _ you _ feel bad ; you 've befriended me . 
 but what i want to say , is , do n't _ you _ ever get drunk -- then you wo n't 
 ever get here . stand a litter furder west -- so -- that 's it ; it 's a prime 
 comfort to see faces that 's friendly when a body 's in such a muck 
 of trouble , and there do n't none come here but yourn . good friendly 
 faces -- good friendly faces . git up on one another 's backs and let me 
 touch 'em . that 's it . shake hands -- yourn'll come through the bars , but 
 mine 's too big . little hands , and weak -- but they 've helped muff potter a 
 power , and they 'd help him more if they could . ” 

 tom went home miserable , and his dreams that night were full of horrors . 
 the next day and the day after , he hung about the courtroom , drawn by an 
 almost irresistible impulse to go in , but forcing himself to stay out . 
 huck was having the same experience . they studiously avoided each other . 
 each wandered away , from time to time , but the same dismal fascination 
 always brought them back presently . tom kept his ears open when idlers 
 sauntered out of the courtroom , but invariably heard distressing 
 news -- the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor 
 potter . at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect 
 that injun joe 's evidence stood firm and unshaken , and that there was 
 not the slightest question as to what the jury 's verdict would be . 

 tom was out late , that night , and came to bed through the window . he 
 was in a tremendous state of excitement . it was hours before he got to 
 sleep . all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning , for 
 this was to be the great day . both sexes were about equally represented 
 in the packed audience . after a long wait the jury filed in and took 
 their places ; shortly afterward , potter , pale and haggard , timid and 
 hopeless , was brought in , with chains upon him , and seated where all 
 the curious eyes could stare at him ; no less conspicuous was injun joe , 
 stolid as ever . there was another pause , and then the judge arrived and 
 the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court . the usual whisperings 
 among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed . these 
 details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation 
 that was as impressive as it was fascinating . 

 now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing 
 in the brook , at an early hour of the morning that the murder was 
 discovered , and that he immediately sneaked away . after some further 
 questioning , counsel for the prosecution said : 

 “ take the witness . ” 

 the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment , but dropped them again when 
 his own counsel said : 

 “ i have no questions to ask him . ” 

 the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse . 
 counsel for the prosecution said : 

 “ take the witness . ” 

 “ i have no questions to ask him , ” potter 's lawyer replied . 

 a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potter 's 
 possession . 

 “ take the witness . ” 

 counsel for potter declined to question him . the faces of the audience 
 began to betray annoyance . did this attorney mean to throw away his 
 client 's life without an effort ? 

 several witnesses deposed concerning potter 's guilty behavior when 
 brought to the scene of the murder . they were allowed to leave the stand 
 without being cross - questioned . 

 every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the 
 graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was 
 brought out by credible witnesses , but none of them were cross - examined 
 by potter 's lawyer . the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house 
 expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench . 
 counsel for the prosecution now said : 

 “ by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion , we have 
 fastened this awful crime , beyond all possibility of question , upon the 
 unhappy prisoner at the bar . we rest our case here . ” 

 a groan escaped from poor potter , and he put his face in his hands and 
 rocked his body softly to and fro , while a painful silence reigned 
 in the courtroom . many men were moved , and many women 's compassion 
 testified itself in tears . counsel for the defence rose and said : 

 “ your honor , in our remarks at the opening of this trial , we 
 foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed 
 while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced 
 by drink . we have changed our mind . we shall not offer that plea . ” [ then 
 to the clerk : ] “ call thomas sawyer ! ” 

 a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house , not even excepting 
 potter 's . every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as 
 he rose and took his place upon the stand . the boy looked wild enough , 
 for he was badly scared . the oath was administered . 

 “ thomas sawyer , where were you on the seventeenth of june , about the 
 hour of midnight ? ” 

 tom glanced at injun joe 's iron face and his tongue failed him . the 
 audience listened breathless , but the words refused to come . after a few 
 moments , however , the boy got a little of his strength back , and managed 
 to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear : 

 “ in the graveyard ! ” 

 “ a little bit louder , please . do n't be afraid . you were-- ” 

 “ in the graveyard . ” 

 a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joe 's face . 

 “ were you anywhere near horse williams ' grave ? ” 

 “ yes , sir . ” 

 “ speak up -- just a trifle louder . how near were you ? ” 

 “ near as i am to you . ” 

 “ were you hidden , or not ? ” 

 “ i was hid . ” 

 “ where ? ” 

 “ behind the elms that 's on the edge of the grave . ” 

 injun joe gave a barely perceptible start . 

 “ any one with you ? ” 

 “ yes , sir . i went there with-- ” 

 “ wait -- wait a moment . never mind mentioning your companion 's name . we 
 will produce him at the proper time . did you carry anything there with 
 you . ” 

 tom hesitated and looked confused . 

 “ speak out , my boy -- don't be diffident . the truth is always respectable . 
 what did you take there ? ” 

 “ only a -- a -- dead cat . ” 

 there was a ripple of mirth , which the court checked . 

 “ we will produce the skeleton of that cat . now , my boy , tell us 
 everything that occurred -- tell it in your own way -- don't skip anything , 
 and do n't be afraid . ” 

 tom began -- hesitatingly at first , but as he warmed to his subject his 
 words flowed more and more easily ; in a little while every sound ceased 
 but his own voice ; every eye fixed itself upon him ; with parted lips and 
 bated breath the audience hung upon his words , taking no note of time , 
 rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale . the strain upon pent 
 emotion reached its climax when the boy said : 

 “ --and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell , injun 
 joe jumped with the knife and-- ” 

 crash ! quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window , tore his 
 way through all opposers , and was gone ! 




 chapter xxiv 

 tom was a glittering hero once more -- the pet of the old , the envy of the 
 young . his name even went into immortal print , for the village paper 
 magnified him . there were some that believed he would be president , yet , 
 if he escaped hanging . 

 as usual , the fickle , unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom 
 and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before . but that sort 
 of conduct is to the world 's credit ; therefore it is not well to find 
 fault with it . 

 tom 's days were days of splendor and exultation to him , but his nights 
 were seasons of horror . injun joe infested all his dreams , and always 
 with doom in his eye . hardly any temptation could persuade the boy 
 to stir abroad after nightfall . poor huck was in the same state of 
 wretchedness and terror , for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer 
 the night before the great day of the trial , and huck was sore afraid 
 that his share in the business might leak out , yet , notwithstanding 
 injun joe 's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court . 
 the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy , but what of 
 that ? since tom 's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the 
 lawyer 's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had 
 been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths , huck 's 
 confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated . 

 daily muff potter 's gratitude made tom glad he had spoken ; but nightly 
 he wished he had sealed up his tongue . 

 half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured ; the 
 other half he was afraid he would be . he felt sure he never could draw a 
 safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse . 

 rewards had been offered , the country had been scoured , but no injun 
 joe was found . one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels , a 
 detective , came up from st. louis , moused around , shook his head , looked 
 wise , and made that sort of astounding success which members of that 
 craft usually achieve . that is to say , he “ found a clew . ” but you ca n't 
 hang a “ clew ” for murder , and so after that detective had got through 
 and gone home , tom felt just as insecure as he was before . 

 the slow days drifted on , and each left behind it a slightly lightened 
 weight of apprehension . 




 chapter xxv 

 there comes a time in every rightly - constructed boy 's life when he has 
 a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure . this desire 
 suddenly came upon tom one day . he sallied out to find joe harper , 
 but failed of success . next he sought ben rogers ; he had gone fishing . 
 presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red - handed . huck would 
 answer . tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him 
 confidentially . huck was willing . huck was always willing to take a hand 
 in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital , 
 for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is 
 not money . “ where 'll we dig ? ” said huck . 

 “ oh , most anywhere . ” 

 “ why , is it hid all around ? ” 

 “ no , indeed it ai n't . it 's hid in mighty particular places , 
 huck -- sometimes on islands , sometimes in rotten chests under the end of 
 a limb of an old dead tree , just where the shadow falls at midnight ; but 
 mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses . ” 

 “ who hides it ? ” 

 “ why , robbers , of course -- who'd you reckon ? sunday - school 
 sup'rintendents ? ” 

 “ i do n't know . if ' twas mine i would n't hide it ; i 'd spend it and have a 
 good time . ” 

 “ so would i. but robbers do n't do that way . they always hide it and 
 leave it there . ” 

 “ do n't they come after it any more ? ” 

 “ no , they think they will , but they generally forget the marks , or else 
 they die . anyway , it lays there a long time and gets rusty ; and by and 
 by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks -- a 
 paper that 's got to be ciphered over about a week because it 's mostly 
 signs and hy'roglyphics . ” 

 “ hyro -- which ? ” 

 “ hy'roglyphics -- pictures and things , you know , that do n't seem to mean 
 anything . ” 

 “ have you got one of them papers , tom ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ well then , how you going to find the marks ? ” 

 “ i do n't want any marks . they always bury it under a ha'nted house or on 
 an island , or under a dead tree that 's got one limb sticking out . well , 
 we 've tried jackson 's island a little , and we can try it again some 
 time ; and there 's the old ha'nted house up the still - house branch , and 
 there 's lots of dead - limb trees -- dead loads of ' em . ” 

 “ is it under all of them ? ” 

 “ how you talk ! no ! ” 

 “ then how you going to know which one to go for ? ” 

 “ go for all of ' em ! ” 

 “ why , tom , it 'll take all summer . ” 

 “ well , what of that ? suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars 
 in it , all rusty and gray , or rotten chest full of di'monds . how 's 
 that ? ” 

 huck 's eyes glowed . 

 “ that 's bully . plenty bully enough for me . just you gimme the hundred 
 dollars and i do n't want no di'monds . ” 

 “ all right . but i bet you i ai n't going to throw off on di'monds . some 
 of 'em 's worth twenty dollars apiece -- there ai n't any , hardly , but 's 
 worth six bits or a dollar . ” 

 “ no ! is that so ? ” 

 “ cert'nly -- anybody'll tell you so . hain't you ever seen one , huck ? ” 

 “ not as i remember . ” 

 “ oh , kings have slathers of them . ” 

 “ well , i don ' know no kings , tom . ” 

 “ i reckon you do n't . but if you was to go to europe you 'd see a raft of 
 'em hopping around . ” 

 “ do they hop ? ” 

 “ hop ?-- your granny ! no ! ” 

 “ well , what did you say they did , for ? ” 

 “ shucks , i only meant you 'd _ see _ ' em -- not hopping , of course -- what do 
 they want to hop for ?-- but i mean you 'd just see ' em -- scattered around , 
 you know , in a kind of a general way . like that old humpbacked richard . ” 

 “ richard ? what 's his other name ? ” 

 “ he did n't have any other name . kings do n't have any but a given name . ” 

 “ no ? ” 

 “ but they do n't . ” 

 “ well , if they like it , tom , all right ; but i do n't want to be a king 
 and have only just a given name , like a nigger . but say -- where you going 
 to dig first ? ” 

 “ well , i do n't know . s'pose we tackle that old dead - limb tree on the 
 hill t'other side of still - house branch ? ” 

 “ i 'm agreed . ” 

 so they got a crippled pick and a shovel , and set out on their 
 three - mile tramp . they arrived hot and panting , and threw themselves 
 down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke . 

 “ i like this , ” said tom . 

 “ so do i. ” 

 “ say , huck , if we find a treasure here , what you going to do with your 
 share ? ” 

 “ well , i 'll have pie and a glass of soda every day , and i 'll go to every 
 circus that comes along . i bet i 'll have a gay time . ” 

 “ well , ai n't you going to save any of it ? ” 

 “ save it ? what for ? ” 

 “ why , so as to have something to live on , by and by . ” 

 “ oh , that ai n't any use . pap would come back to thish - yer town some day 
 and get his claws on it if i did n't hurry up , and i tell you he 'd clean 
 it out pretty quick . what you going to do with yourn , tom ? ” 

 “ i 'm going to buy a new drum , and a sure'nough sword , and a red necktie 
 and a bull pup , and get married . ” 

 “ married ! ” 

 “ that 's it . ” 

 “ tom , you -- why , you ai n't in your right mind . ” 

 “ wait -- you'll see . ” 

 “ well , that 's the foolishest thing you could do . look at pap and my 
 mother . fight ! why , they used to fight all the time . i remember , mighty 
 well . ” 

 “ that ai n't anything . the girl i 'm going to marry wo n't fight . ” 

 “ tom , i reckon they 're all alike . they 'll all comb a body . now you 
 better think 'bout this awhile . i tell you you better . what 's the name 
 of the gal ? ” 

 “ it ai n't a gal at all -- it 's a girl . ” 

 “ it 's all the same , i reckon ; some says gal , some says girl -- both 's 
 right , like enough . anyway , what 's her name , tom ? ” 

 “ i 'll tell you some time -- not now . ” 

 “ all right -- that'll do . only if you get married i 'll be more lonesomer 
 than ever . ” 

 “ no you wo n't . you 'll come and live with me . now stir out of this and 
 we 'll go to digging . ” 

 they worked and sweated for half an hour . no result . they toiled another 
 halfhour . still no result . huck said : 

 “ do they always bury it as deep as this ? ” 

 “ sometimes -- not always . not generally . i reckon we have n't got the right 
 place . ” 

 so they chose a new spot and began again . the labor dragged a little , 
 but still they made progress . they pegged away in silence for some time . 
 finally huck leaned on his shovel , swabbed the beaded drops from his 
 brow with his sleeve , and said : 

 “ where you going to dig next , after we get this one ? ” 

 “ i reckon maybe we 'll tackle the old tree that 's over yonder on cardiff 
 hill back of the widow 's . ” 

 “ i reckon that 'll be a good one . but wo n't the widow take it away from 
 us , tom ? it 's on her land . ” 

 “ _ she _ take it away ! maybe she 'd like to try it once . whoever finds one 
 of these hid treasures , it belongs to him . it do n't make any difference 
 whose land it 's on . ” 

 that was satisfactory . the work went on . by and by huck said : 

 “ blame it , we must be in the wrong place again . what do you think ? ” 

 “ it is mighty curious , huck . i do n't understand it . sometimes witches 
 interfere . i reckon maybe that 's what 's the trouble now . ” 

 “ shucks ! witches ai n't got no power in the daytime . ” 

 “ well , that 's so . i did n't think of that . oh , i know what the matter is ! 
 what a blamed lot of fools we are ! you got to find out where the shadow 
 of the limb falls at midnight , and that 's where you dig ! ” 

 “ then consound it , we 've fooled away all this work for nothing . now hang 
 it all , we got to come back in the night . it 's an awful long way . can 
 you get out ? ” 

 “ i bet i will . we 've got to do it tonight , too , because if somebody sees 
 these holes they 'll know in a minute what 's here and they 'll go for it . ” 

 “ well , i 'll come around and maow tonight . ” 

 “ all right . let 's hide the tools in the bushes . ” 

 the boys were there that night , about the appointed time . they sat in 
 the shadow waiting . it was a lonely place , and an hour made solemn by 
 old traditions . spirits whispered in the rustling leaves , ghosts lurked 
 in the murky nooks , the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the 
 distance , an owl answered with his sepulchral note . the boys were 
 subdued by these solemnities , and talked little . by and by they judged 
 that twelve had come ; they marked where the shadow fell , and began to 
 dig . their hopes commenced to rise . their interest grew stronger , and 
 their industry kept pace with it . the hole deepened and still deepened , 
 but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon 
 something , they only suffered a new disappointment . it was only a stone 
 or a chunk . at last tom said : 

 “ it ai n't any use , huck , we 're wrong again . ” 

 “ well , but we _ ca n't _ be wrong . we spotted the shadder to a dot . ” 

 “ i know it , but then there 's another thing . ” 

 “ what 's that ? ” . 

 “ why , we only guessed at the time . like enough it was too late or too 
 early . ” 

 huck dropped his shovel . 

 “ that 's it , ” said he . “ that 's the very trouble . we got to give this one 
 up . we ca n't ever tell the right time , and besides this kind of thing 's 
 too awful , here this time of night with witches and ghosts a - fluttering 
 around so . i feel as if something 's behind me all the time ;   and i 'm 
 afeard to turn around , becuz maybe there 's others in front a - waiting for 
 a chance . i been creeping all over , ever since i got here . ” 

 “ well , i 've been pretty much so , too , huck . they most always put in a 
 dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree , to look out for it . ” 

 “ lordy ! ” 

 “ yes , they do . i 've always heard that . ” 

 “ tom , i do n't like to fool around much where there 's dead people . a 
 body 's bound to get into trouble with 'em , sure . ” 

 “ i do n't like to stir 'em up , either . s'pose this one here was to stick 
 his skull out and say something ! ” 

 “ do n't tom ! it 's awful . ” 

 “ well , it just is . huck , i do n't feel comfortable a bit . ” 

 “ say , tom , let 's give this place up , and try somewheres else . ” 

 “ all right , i reckon we better . ” 

 “ what 'll it be ? ” 

 tom considered awhile ; and then said : 

 “ the ha'nted house . that 's it ! ” 

 “ blame it , i do n't like ha'nted houses , tom . why , they 're a dern sight 
 worse'n dead people . dead people might talk , maybe , but they do n't come 
 sliding around in a shroud , when you ai n't noticing , and peep over your 
 shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth , the way a ghost does . i 
 could n't stand such a thing as that , tom -- nobody could . ” 

 “ yes , but , huck , ghosts do n't travel around only at night . they wo n't 
 hender us from digging there in the daytime . ” 

 “ well , that 's so . but you know mighty well people do n't go about that 
 ha'nted house in the day nor the night . ” 

 “ well , that 's mostly because they do n't like to go where a man 's been 
 murdered , anyway -- but nothing 's ever been seen around that house except 
 in the night -- just some blue lights slipping by the windows -- no regular 
 ghosts . ” 

 “ well , where you see one of them blue lights flickering around , tom , 
 you can bet there 's a ghost mighty close behind it . it stands to reason . 
 becuz you know that they do n't anybody but ghosts use ' em . ” 

 “ yes , that 's so . but anyway they do n't come around in the daytime , so 
 what 's the use of our being afeard ? ” 

 “ well , all right . we 'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so -- but i 
 reckon it 's taking chances . ” 

 they had started down the hill by this time . there in the middle of the 
 moonlit valley below them stood the “ ha'nted ” house , utterly isolated , 
 its fences gone long ago , rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps , the 
 chimney crumbled to ruin , the window - sashes vacant , a corner of the roof 
 caved in . the boys gazed awhile , half expecting to see a blue light flit 
 past a window ; then talking in a low tone , as befitted the time and the 
 circumstances , they struck far off to the right , to give the haunted 
 house a wide berth , and took their way homeward through the woods that 
 adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill . 




 chapter xvi 

 about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree ; they had come 
 for their tools . tom was impatient to go to the haunted house ; huck was 
 measurably so , also -- but suddenly said : 

 “ lookyhere , tom , do you know what day it is ? ” 

 tom mentally ran over the days of the week , and then quickly lifted his 
 eyes with a startled look in them-- 

 “ my ! i never once thought of it , huck ! ” 

 “ well , i did n't neither , but all at once it popped onto me that it was 
 friday . ” 

 “ blame it , a body ca n't be too careful , huck . we might ' a ' got into an 
 awful scrape , tackling such a thing on a friday . ” 

 “ _ might _ ! better say we _ would _ ! there 's some lucky days , maybe , but 
 friday ai n't . ” 

 “ any fool knows that . i do n't reckon _ you _ was the first that found it 
 out , huck . ” 

 “ well , i never said i was , did i ? and friday ai n't all , neither . i had a 
 rotten bad dream last night -- dreampt about rats . ” 

 “ no ! sure sign of trouble . did they fight ? ” 

 “ no . ” 

 “ well , that 's good , huck . when they do n't fight it 's only a sign that 
 there 's trouble around , you know . all we got to do is to look mighty 
 sharp and keep out of it . we 'll drop this thing for today , and play . do 
 you know robin hood , huck ? ” 

 “ no . who 's robin hood ? ” 

 “ why , he was one of the greatest men that was ever in england -- and the 
 best . he was a robber . ” 

 “ cracky , i wisht i was . who did he rob ? ” 

 “ only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings , and such like . but 
 he never bothered the poor . he loved 'em . he always divided up with 'em 
 perfectly square . ” 

 “ well , he must ' a ' been a brick . ” 

 “ i bet you he was , huck . oh , he was the noblest man that ever was . 
 they ai n't any such men now , i can tell you . he could lick any man in 
 england , with one hand tied behind him ; and he could take his yew bow 
 and plug a ten - cent piece every time , a mile and a half . ” 

 “ what 's a _ yew _ bow ? ” 

 “ i do n't know . it 's some kind of a bow , of course . and if he hit that 
 dime only on the edge he would set down and cry -- and curse . but we 'll 
 play robin hood -- it 's nobby fun . i 'll learn you . ” 

 “ i 'm agreed . ” 

 so they played robin hood all the afternoon , now and then casting a 
 yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the 
 morrow 's prospects and possibilities there . as the sun began to sink 
 into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows 
 of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff 
 hill . 

 on saturday , shortly after noon , the boys were at the dead tree again . 
 they had a smoke and a chat in the shade , and then dug a little in their 
 last hole , not with great hope , but merely because tom said there were 
 so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down 
 within six inches of it , and then somebody else had come along and 
 turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel . the thing failed this 
 time , however , so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling 
 that they had not trifled with fortune , but had fulfilled all the 
 requirements that belong to the business of treasure - hunting . 

 when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and 
 grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun , 
 and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the 
 place , that they were afraid , for a moment , to venture in . then they 
 crept to the door and took a trembling peep . they saw a weedgrown , 
 floorless room , unplastered , an ancient fireplace , vacant windows , 
 a ruinous staircase ; and here , there , and everywhere hung ragged and 
 abandoned cobwebs . they presently entered , softly , with quickened 
 pulses , talking in whispers , ears alert to catch the slightest sound , 
 and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat . 

 in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the 
 place a critical and interested examination , rather admiring their own 
 boldness , and wondering at it , too . next they wanted to look upstairs . 
 this was something like cutting off retreat , but they got to daring 
 each other , and of course there could be but one result -- they threw their 
 tools into a corner and made the ascent . up there were the same signs of 
 decay . in one corner they found a closet that promised mystery , but the 
 promise was a fraud -- there was nothing in it . their courage was up now 
 and well in hand . they were about to go down and begin work when-- 

 “ sh ! ” said tom . 

 “ what is it ? ” whispered huck , blanching with fright . 

 “ sh ! ... there ! ... hear it ? ” 

 “ yes ! ... oh , my ! let 's run ! ” 

 “ keep still ! do n't you budge ! they 're coming right toward the door . ” 

 the boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to 
 knotholes in the planking , and lay waiting , in a misery of fear . 

 “ they 've stopped .... no -- coming .... here they are . do n't whisper another 
 word , huck . my goodness , i wish i was out of this ! ” 

 two men entered . each boy said to himself : “ there 's the old deaf and 
 dumb spaniard that 's been about town once or twice lately -- never saw 
 t'other man before . ” 

 “ t'other ” was a ragged , unkempt creature , with nothing very pleasant 
 in his face . the spaniard was wrapped in a serape ; he had bushy white 
 whiskers ; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero , and he wore 
 green goggles . when they came in , “ t'other ” was talking in a low voice ; 
 they sat down on the ground , facing the door , with their backs to the 
 wall , and the speaker continued his remarks . his manner became less 
 guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded : 

 “ no , ” said he , “ i 've thought it all over , and i do n't like it . it 's 
 dangerous . ” 

 “ dangerous ! ” grunted the “ deaf and dumb ” spaniard -- to the vast surprise 
 of the boys . “ milksop ! ” 

 this voice made the boys gasp and quake . it was injun joe 's ! there was 
 silence for some time . then joe said : 

 “ what 's any more dangerous than that job up yonder -- but nothing 's come of 
 it . ” 

 “ that 's different . away up the river so , and not another house about . 
 ' twon't ever be known that we tried , anyway , long as we did n't succeed . ” 

 “ well , what 's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody 
 would suspicion us that saw us . ” 

 “ i know that . but there warn't any other place as handy after that fool 
 of a job . i want to quit this shanty . i wanted to yesterday , only it 
 warn't any use trying to stir out of here , with those infernal boys 
 playing over there on the hill right in full view . ” 

 “ those infernal boys ” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark , 
 and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and 
 concluded to wait a day . they wished in their hearts they had waited a 
 year . 

 the two men got out some food and made a luncheon . after a long and 
 thoughtful silence , injun joe said : 

 “ look here , lad -- you go back up the river where you belong . wait there 
 till you hear from me . i 'll take the chances on dropping into this town 
 just once more , for a look . we 'll do that ' dangerous ' job after i 've 
 spied around a little and think things look well for it . then for texas ! 
 we 'll leg it together ! ” 

 this was satisfactory . both men presently fell to yawning , and injun joe 
 said : 

 “ i 'm dead for sleep ! it 's your turn to watch . ” 

 he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore . his comrade stirred 
 him once or twice and he became quiet . presently the watcher began to 
 nod ; his head drooped lower and lower , both men began to snore now . 

 the boys drew a long , grateful breath . tom whispered : 

 “ now 's our chance -- come ! ” 

 huck said : 

 “ i can't -- i'd die if they was to wake . ” 

 tom urged -- huck held back . at last tom rose slowly and softly , and 
 started alone . but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak 
 from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright . he never 
 made a second attempt . the boys lay there counting the dragging moments 
 till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray ; 
 and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting . 

 now one snore ceased . injun joe sat up , stared around -- smiled grimly upon 
 his comrade , whose head was drooping upon his knees -- stirred him up with 
 his foot and said : 

 “ here ! _ you 're _ a watchman , ai n't you ! all right , though -- nothing 's 
 happened . ” 

 “ my ! have i been asleep ? ” 

 “ oh , partly , partly . nearly time for us to be moving , pard . what 'll we 
 do with what little swag we 've got left ? ” 

 “ i do n't know -- leave it here as we 've always done , i reckon . no use to 
 take it away till we start south . six hundred and fifty in silver 's 
 something to carry . ” 

 “ well -- all right -- it wo n't matter to come here once more . ” 

 “ no -- but i 'd say come in the night as we used to do -- it 's better . ” 

 “ yes : but look here ; it may be a good while before i get the right 
 chance at that job ; accidents might happen ; ' tain't in such a very good 
 place ; we 'll just regularly bury it -- and bury it deep . ” 

 “ good idea , ” said the comrade , who walked across the room , knelt down , 
 raised one of the rearward hearth - stones and took out a bag that jingled 
 pleasantly . he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself 
 and as much for injun joe , and passed the bag to the latter , who was on 
 his knees in the corner , now , digging with his bowie - knife . 

 the boys forgot all their fears , all their miseries in an instant . with 
 gloating eyes they watched every movement . luck!--the splendor of it was 
 beyond all imagination ! six hundred dollars was money enough to make 
 half a dozen boys rich ! here was treasure - hunting under the happiest 
 auspices -- there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to 
 dig . they nudged each other every moment -- eloquent nudges and easily 
 understood , for they simply meant--“oh , but ai n't you glad _ now _ we 're 
 here ! ” 

 joe 's knife struck upon something . 

 “ hello ! ” said he . 

 “ what is it ? ” said his comrade . 

 “ half - rotten plank -- no , it 's a box , i believe . here -- bear a hand and we 'll 
 see what it 's here for . never mind , i 've broke a hole . ” 

 he reached his hand in and drew it out-- 

 “ man , it 's money ! ” 

 the two men examined the handful of coins . they were gold . the boys 
 above were as excited as themselves , and as delighted . 

 joe 's comrade said : 

 “ we 'll make quick work of this . there 's an old rusty pick over amongst 
 the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace -- i saw it a 
 minute ago . ” 

 he ran and brought the boys ' pick and shovel . injun joe took the 
 pick , looked it over critically , shook his head , muttered something to 
 himself , and then began to use it . the box was soon unearthed . it was 
 not very large ; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the 
 slow years had injured it . the men contemplated the treasure awhile in 
 blissful silence . 

 “ pard , there 's thousands of dollars here , ” said injun joe . 

 “ ' twas always said that murrel 's gang used to be around here one 
 summer , ” the stranger observed . 

 “ i know it , ” said injun joe ; “ and this looks like it , i should say . ” 

 “ now you wo n't need to do that job . ” 

 the halfbreed frowned . said he : 

 “ you do n't know me . least you do n't know all about that thing . ' tain't 
 robbery altogether -- it 's _ revenge _ ! ” and a wicked light flamed in his 
 eyes . “ i 'll need your help in it . when it 's finished -- then texas . go home 
 to your nance and your kids , and stand by till you hear from me . ” 

 “ well -- if you say so ; what 'll we do with this -- bury it again ? ” 

 “ yes . [ ravishing delight overhead . ] _ no _ ! by the great sachem , no ! 
 [ profound distress overhead . ] i 'd nearly forgot . that pick had fresh 
 earth on it ! [ the boys were sick with terror in a moment . ] what business 
 has a pick and a shovel here ? what business with fresh earth on 
 them ? who brought them here -- and where are they gone ? have you heard 
 anybody ?-- seen anybody ? what ! bury it again and leave them to come and 
 see the ground disturbed ? not exactly -- not exactly . we 'll take it to my 
 den . ” 

 “ why , of course ! might have thought of that before . you mean number 
 one ? ” 

 “ no -- number two -- under the cross . the other place is bad -- too common . ” 

 “ all right . it 's nearly dark enough to start . ” 

 injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping 
 out . presently he said : 

 “ who could have brought those tools here ? do you reckon they can be 
 upstairs ? ” 

 the boys ' breath forsook them . injun joe put his hand on his knife , 
 halted a moment , undecided , and then turned toward the stairway . the 
 boys thought of the closet , but their strength was gone . the steps came 
 creaking up the stairs -- the intolerable distress of the situation woke 
 the stricken resolution of the lads -- they were about to spring for the 
 closet , when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed on 
 the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway . he gathered himself 
 up cursing , and his comrade said : 

 “ now what 's the use of all that ? if it 's anybody , and they 're up there , 
 let them _ stay _ there -- who cares ? if they want to jump down , now , and get 
 into trouble , who objects ? it will be dark in fifteen minutes -- and then 
 let them follow us if they want to . i 'm willing . in my opinion , whoever 
 hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or 
 devils or something . i 'll bet they 're running yet . ” 

 joe grumbled awhile ; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight 
 was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving . 
 shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening 
 twilight , and moved toward the river with their precious box . 

 tom and huck rose up , weak but vastly relieved , and stared after them 
 through the chinks between the logs of the house . follow ? not they . they 
 were content to reach ground again without broken necks , and take the 
 townward track over the hill . they did not talk much . they were too much 
 absorbed in hating themselves -- hating the ill luck that made them take 
 the spade and the pick there . but for that , injun joe never would have 
 suspected . he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait 
 there till his “ revenge ” was satisfied , and then he would have had the 
 misfortune to find that money turn up missing . bitter , bitter luck that 
 the tools were ever brought there ! 

 they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to 
 town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job , and follow him to 
 “ number two , ” wherever that might be . then a ghastly thought occurred to 
 tom . 

 “ revenge ? what if he means _ us _ , huck ! ” 

 “ oh , do n't ! ” said huck , nearly fainting . 

 they talked it all over , and as they entered town they agreed to believe 
 that he might possibly mean somebody else -- at least that he might at 
 least mean nobody but tom , since only tom had testified . 

 very , very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger ! company 
 would be a palpable improvement , he thought . 




 chapter xxvii 

 the adventure of the day mightily tormented tom 's dreams that night . 
 four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times 
 it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and 
 wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune . as he lay 
 in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure , he 
 noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away -- somewhat as if 
 they had happened in another world , or in a time long gone by . then it 
 occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream ! there 
 was one very strong argument in favor of this idea -- namely , that the 
 quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real . he had never seen 
 as much as fifty dollars in one mass before , and he was like all boys of 
 his age and station in life , in that he imagined that all references to 
 “ hundreds ” and “ thousands ” were mere fanciful forms of speech , and that 
 no such sums really existed in the world . he never had supposed for 
 a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in 
 actual money in any one 's possession . if his notions of hidden treasure 
 had been analyzed , they would have been found to consist of a handful of 
 real dimes and a bushel of vague , splendid , ungraspable dollars . 

 but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer 
 under the attrition of thinking them over , and so he presently found 
 himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a 
 dream , after all . this uncertainty must be swept away . he would snatch a 
 hurried breakfast and go and find huck . huck was sitting on the gunwale 
 of a flatboat , listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking 
 very melancholy . tom concluded to let huck lead up to the subject . if 
 he did not do it , then the adventure would be proved to have been only a 
 dream . 

 “ hello , huck ! ” 

 “ hello , yourself . ” 

 silence , for a minute . 

 “ tom , if we 'd ' a ' left the blame tools at the dead tree , we 'd ' a ' got 
 the money . oh , ai n't it awful ! ” 

 “ ' tain't a dream , then , ' tain't a dream ! somehow i most wish it was . 
 dog'd if i do n't , huck . ” 

 “ what ai n't a dream ? ” 

 “ oh , that thing yesterday . i been half thinking it was . ” 

 “ dream ! if them stairs had n't broke down you 'd ' a ' seen how much dream 
 it was ! i 've had dreams enough all night -- with that patch - eyed spanish 
 devil going for me all through ' em -- rot him ! ” 

 “ no , not rot him . _ find _ him ! track the money ! ” 

 “ tom , we 'll never find him . a feller do n't have only one chance for such 
 a pile -- and that one 's lost . i 'd feel mighty shaky if i was to see him , 
 anyway . ” 

 “ well , so'd i ; but i 'd like to see him , anyway -- and track him out -- to his 
 number two . ” 

 “ number two -- yes , that 's it . i been thinking 'bout that . but i ca n't make 
 nothing out of it . what do you reckon it is ? ” 

 “ i dono . it 's too deep . say , huck -- maybe it 's the number of a house ! ” 

 “ goody ! ... no , tom , that ai n't it . if it is , it ai n't in this one - horse 
 town . they ai n't no numbers here . ” 

 “ well , that 's so . lemme think a minute . here -- it 's the number of a 
 room -- in a tavern , you know ! ” 

 “ oh , that 's the trick ! they ai n't only two taverns . we can find out 
 quick . ” 

 “ you stay here , huck , till i come . ” 

 tom was off at once . he did not care to have huck 's company in public 
 places . he was gone half an hour . he found that in the best tavern , no . 
 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer , and was still so occupied . 
 in the less ostentatious house , no . 2 was a mystery . the tavern - keeper 's 
 young son said it was kept locked all the time , and he never saw anybody 
 go into it or come out of it except at night ; he did not know any 
 particular reason for this state of things ; had had some little 
 curiosity , but it was rather feeble ; had made the most of the mystery 
 by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ ha'nted ” ; had 
 noticed that there was a light in there the night before . 

 “ that 's what i 've found out , huck . i reckon that 's the very no . 2 we 're 
 after . ” 

 “ i reckon it is , tom . now what you going to do ? ” 

 “ lemme think . ” 

 tom thought a long time . then he said : 

 “ i 'll tell you . the back door of that no . 2 is the door that comes out 
 into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap 
 of a brick store . now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find , and 
 i 'll nip all of auntie 's , and the first dark night we 'll go there and 
 try 'em . and mind you , keep a lookout for injun joe , because he said he 
 was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get 
 his revenge . if you see him , you just follow him ; and if he do n't go to 
 that no . 2 , that ai n't the place . ” 

 “ lordy , i do n't want to foller him by myself ! ” 

 “ why , it 'll be night , sure . he might n't ever see you -- and if he did , 
 maybe he 'd never think anything . ” 

 “ well , if it 's pretty dark i reckon i 'll track him . i dono -- i dono . i 'll 
 try . ” 

 “ you bet i 'll follow him , if it 's dark , huck . why , he might ' a ' found 
 out he could n't get his revenge , and be going right after that money . ” 

 “ it 's so , tom , it 's so . i 'll foller him ; i will , by jingoes ! ” 

 “ now you 're _ talking _ ! do n't you ever weaken , huck , and i wo n't . ” 




 chapter xxviii 

 that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure . they hung about 
 the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine , one watching the alley 
 at a distance and the other the tavern door . nobody entered the alley or 
 left it ; nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern 
 door . the night promised to be a fair one ; so tom went home with the 
 understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on , huck 
 was to come and “ maow , ” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys . 
 but the night remained clear , and huck closed his watch and retired to 
 bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve . 

 tuesday the boys had the same ill luck . also wednesday . but thursday 
 night promised better . tom slipped out in good season with his aunt 's 
 old tin lantern , and a large towel to blindfold it with . he hid the 
 lantern in huck 's sugar hogshead and the watch began . an hour before 
 midnight the tavern closed up and its lights ( the only ones thereabouts ) 
 were put out . no spaniard had been seen . nobody had entered or left the 
 alley . everything was auspicious . the blackness of darkness reigned , 
 the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of 
 distant thunder . 

 tom got his lantern , lit it in the hogshead , wrapped it closely in the 
 towel , and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern . 
 huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley . then there was 
 a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon huck 's spirits like a 
 mountain . he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern -- it 
 would frighten him , but it would at least tell him that tom was alive 
 yet . it seemed hours since tom had disappeared . surely he must have 
 fainted ; maybe he was dead ; maybe his heart had burst under terror and 
 excitement . in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer 
 and closer to the alley ; fearing all sorts of dreadful things , and 
 momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away 
 his breath . there was not much to take away , for he seemed only able to 
 inhale it by thimblefuls , and his heart would soon wear itself out , the 
 way it was beating . suddenly there was a flash of light and tom came 
 tearing by him : “ run ! ” said he ; “ run , for your life ! ” 

 he need n't have repeated it ; once was enough ; huck was making thirty or 
 forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered . the boys never 
 stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter - house at the 
 lower end of the village . just as they got within its shelter the storm 
 burst and the rain poured down . as soon as tom got his breath he said : 

 “ huck , it was awful ! i tried two of the keys , just as soft as i could ; 
 but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i could n't hardly 
 get my breath i was so scared . they would n't turn in the lock , either . 
 well , without noticing what i was doing , i took hold of the knob , and 
 open comes the door ! it warn't locked ! i hopped in , and shook off the 
 towel , and , _ great caesar 's ghost ! _ ” 

 “ what!--what'd you see , tom ? ” 

 “ huck , i most stepped onto injun joe 's hand ! ” 

 “ no ! ” 

 “ yes ! he was lying there , sound asleep on the floor , with his old patch 
 on his eye and his arms spread out . ” 

 “ lordy , what did you do ? did he wake up ? ” 

 “ no , never budged . drunk , i reckon . i just grabbed that towel and 
 started ! ” 

 “ i 'd never ' a ' thought of the towel , i bet ! ” 

 “ well , i would . my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it . ” 

 “ say , tom , did you see that box ? ” 

 “ huck , i did n't wait to look around . i did n't see the box , i did n't see 
 the cross . i did n't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor 
 by injun joe ; yes , i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room . 
 do n't you see , now , what 's the matter with that ha'nted room ? ” 

 “ how ? ” 

 “ why , it 's ha'nted with whiskey ! maybe _ all _ the temperance taverns have 
 got a ha'nted room , hey , huck ? ” 

 “ well , i reckon maybe that 's so . who 'd ' a ' thought such a thing ? but 
 say , tom , now 's a mighty good time to get that box , if injun joe 's 
 drunk . ” 

 “ it is , that ! you try it ! ” 

 huck shuddered . 

 “ well , no -- i reckon not . ” 

 “ and i reckon not , huck . only one bottle alongside of injun joe ai n't 
 enough . if there 'd been three , he 'd be drunk enough and i 'd do it . ” 

 there was a long pause for reflection , and then tom said : 

 “ lookyhere , huck , less not try that thing any more till we know injun 
 joe 's not in there . it 's too scary . now , if we watch every night , we 'll 
 be dead sure to see him go out , some time or other , and then we 'll 
 snatch that box quicker'n lightning . ” 

 “ well , i 'm agreed . i 'll watch the whole night long , and i 'll do it every 
 night , too , if you 'll do the other part of the job . ” 

 “ all right , i will . all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a 
 block and maow -- and if i 'm asleep , you throw some gravel at the window 
 and that 'll fetch me . ” 

 “ agreed , and good as wheat ! ” 

 “ now , huck , the storm 's over , and i 'll go home . it 'll begin to be 
 daylight in a couple of hours . you go back and watch that long , will 
 you ? ” 

 “ i said i would , tom , and i will . i 'll ha'nt that tavern every night for 
 a year ! i 'll sleep all day and i 'll stand watch all night . ” 

 “ that 's all right . now , where you going to sleep ? ” 

 “ in ben rogers ' hayloft . he lets me , and so does his pap 's nigger man , 
 uncle jake . i tote water for uncle jake whenever he wants me to , and any 
 time i ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it . 
 that 's a mighty good nigger , tom . he likes me , becuz i do n't ever act as 
 if i was above him . sometime i 've set right down and eat _ with _ him . but 
 you need n't tell that . a body 's got to do things when he 's awful hungry 
 he would n't want to do as a steady thing . ” 

 “ well , if i do n't want you in the daytime , i 'll let you sleep . i wo n't 
 come bothering around . any time you see something 's up , in the night , 
 just skip right around and maow . ” 




 chapter xxix 

 the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of 
 news -- judge thatcher 's family had come back to town the night before . 
 both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a 
 moment , and becky took the chief place in the boy 's interest . he saw her 
 and they had an exhausting good time playing “ hispy ” and “ gully - keeper ” 
  with a crowd of their schoolmates . the day was completed and crowned in 
 a peculiarly satisfactory way : becky teased her mother to appoint 
 the next day for the long - promised and long - delayed picnic , and she 
 consented . the child 's delight was boundless ; and tom 's not more 
 moderate . the invitations were sent out before sunset , and straightway 
 the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation 
 and pleasurable anticipation . tom 's excitement enabled him to keep 
 awake until a pretty late hour , and he had good hopes of hearing huck 's 
 “ maow , ” and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers 
 with , next day ; but he was disappointed . no signal came that night . 

 morning came , eventually , and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and 
 rollicking company were gathered at judge thatcher 's , and everything was 
 ready for a start . it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the 
 picnics with their presence . the children were considered safe enough 
 under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young 
 gentlemen of twenty - three or thereabouts . the old steam ferry - boat was 
 chartered for the occasion ; presently the gay throng filed up the main 
 street laden with provision - baskets . sid was sick and had to miss 
 the fun ; mary remained at home to entertain him . the last thing mrs. 
 thatcher said to becky , was : 

 “ you 'll not get back till late . perhaps you 'd better stay all night with 
 some of the girls that live near the ferry - landing , child . ” 

 “ then i 'll stay with susy harper , mamma . ” 

 “ very well . and mind and behave yourself and do n't be any trouble . ” 

 presently , as they tripped along , tom said to becky : 

 “ say -- i'll tell you what we 'll do . ' stead of going to joe harper 's we 'll 
 climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas ' . she 'll have 
 ice - cream ! she has it most every day -- dead loads of it . and she 'll be 
 awful glad to have us . ” 

 “ oh , that will be fun ! ” 

 then becky reflected a moment and said : 

 “ but what will mamma say ? ” 

 “ how 'll she ever know ? ” 

 the girl turned the idea over in her mind , and said reluctantly : 

 “ i reckon it 's wrong -- but-- ” 

 “ but shucks ! your mother wo n't know , and so what 's the harm ? all she 
 wants is that you 'll be safe ; and i bet you she 'd ' a ' said go there if 
 she 'd ' a ' thought of it . i know she would ! ” 

 the widow douglas ' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait . it and 
 tom 's persuasions presently carried the day . so it was decided to say 
 nothing to anybody about the night 's programme . presently it occurred to 
 tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal . the 
 thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations . still he 
 could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas ' . and why should he 
 give it up , he reasoned -- the signal did not come the night before , so 
 why should it be any more likely to come tonight ? the sure fun of the 
 evening outweighed the uncertain treasure ; and , boy - like , he determined 
 to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of 
 the box of money another time that day . 

 three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody 
 hollow and tied up . the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest 
 distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and 
 laughter . all the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone 
 through with , and by - and - by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified 
 with responsible appetites , and then the destruction of the good things 
 began . after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in 
 the shade of spreading oaks . by - and - by somebody shouted : 

 “ who 's ready for the cave ? ” 

 everybody was . bundles of candles were procured , and straightway there 
 was a general scamper up the hill . the mouth of the cave was up the 
 hillside -- an opening shaped like a letter a. its massive oaken door stood 
 unbarred . within was a small chamber , chilly as an icehouse , and walled 
 by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat . it was 
 romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out 
 upon the green valley shining in the sun . but the impressiveness of the 
 situation quickly wore off , and the romping began again . the moment 
 a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it ; a 
 struggle and a gallant defence followed , but the candle was soon knocked 
 down or blown out , and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a 
 new chase . but all things have an end . by - and - by the procession went 
 filing down the steep descent of the main avenue , the flickering rank of 
 lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of 
 junction sixty feet overhead . this main avenue was not more than 
 eight or ten feet wide . every few steps other lofty and still narrower 
 crevices branched from it on either hand -- for mcdougal 's cave was but a 
 vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again 
 and led nowhere . it was said that one might wander days and nights 
 together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms , and never 
 find the end of the cave ; and that he might go down , and down , and 
 still down , into the earth , and it was just the same -- labyrinth under 
 labyrinth , and no end to any of them . no man “ knew ” the cave . that was 
 an impossible thing . most of the young men knew a portion of it , and it 
 was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion . tom sawyer 
 knew as much of the cave as any one . 

 the procession moved along the main avenue some three - quarters of 
 a mile , and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch 
 avenues , fly along the dismal corridors , and take each other by surprise 
 at points where the corridors joined again . parties were able to elude 
 each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the 
 “ known ” ground . 

 by - and - by , one group after another came straggling back to the mouth 
 of the cave , panting , hilarious , smeared from head to foot with tallow 
 drippings , daubed with clay , and entirely delighted with the success of 
 the day . then they were astonished to find that they had been taking 
 no note of time and that night was about at hand . the clanging bell had 
 been calling for half an hour . however , this sort of close to the day 's 
 adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory . when the ferryboat 
 with her wild freight pushed into the stream , nobody cared sixpence for 
 the wasted time but the captain of the craft . 

 huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat 's lights went 
 glinting past the wharf . he heard no noise on board , for the young 
 people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly 
 tired to death . he wondered what boat it was , and why she did not 
 stop at the wharf -- and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his 
 attention upon his business . the night was growing cloudy and dark . ten 
 o'clock came , and the noise of vehicles ceased , scattered lights began 
 to wink out , all straggling foot - passengers disappeared , the village 
 betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the 
 silence and the ghosts . eleven o'clock came , and the tavern lights were 
 put out ; darkness everywhere , now . huck waited what seemed a weary long 
 time , but nothing happened . his faith was weakening . was there any use ? 
 was there really any use ? why not give it up and turn in ? 

 a noise fell upon his ear . he was all attention in an instant . the alley 
 door closed softly . he sprang to the corner of the brick store . the next 
 moment two men brushed by him , and one seemed to have something under 
 his arm . it must be that box ! so they were going to remove the treasure . 
 why call tom now ? it would be absurd -- the men would get away with the box 
 and never be found again . no , he would stick to their wake and follow 
 them ; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery . so 
 communing with himself , huck stepped out and glided along behind the 
 men , cat - like , with bare feet , allowing them to keep just far enough 
 ahead not to be invisible . 

 they moved up the river street three blocks , then turned to the left up 
 a crossstreet . they went straight ahead , then , until they came to the 
 path that led up cardiff hill ; this they took . they passed by the old 
 welshman 's house , halfway up the hill , without hesitating , and still 
 climbed upward . good , thought huck , they will bury it in the old quarry . 
 but they never stopped at the quarry . they passed on , up the summit . 
 they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes , and 
 were at once hidden in the gloom . huck closed up and shortened his 
 distance , now , for they would never be able to see him . he trotted along 
 awhile ; then slackened his pace , fearing he was gaining too fast ; moved 
 on a piece , then stopped altogether ; listened ; no sound ; none , save that 
 he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart . the hooting of an 
 owl came over the hill -- ominous sound ! but no footsteps . heavens , was 
 everything lost ! he was about to spring with winged feet , when a man 
 cleared his throat not four feet from him ! huck 's heart shot into his 
 throat , but he swallowed it again ; and then he stood there shaking as 
 if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once , and so weak that he 
 thought he must surely fall to the ground . he knew where he was . he 
 knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas ' 
 grounds . very well , he thought , let them bury it there ; it wo n't be hard 
 to find . 

 now there was a voice -- a very low voice -- injun joe 's : 

 “ damn her , maybe she 's got company -- there 's lights , late as it is . ” 

 “ i ca n't see any . ” 

 this was that stranger 's voice -- the stranger of the haunted house . a 
 deadly chill went to huck 's heart -- this , then , was the “ revenge ” job ! his 
 thought was , to fly . then he remembered that the widow douglas had been 
 kind to him more than once , and maybe these men were going to murder 
 her . he wished he dared venture to warn her ; but he knew he did n't 
 dare -- they might come and catch him . he thought all this and more in 
 the moment that elapsed between the stranger 's remark and injun joe 's 
 next -- which was-- 

 “ because the bush is in your way . now -- this way -- now you see , do n't you ? ” 

 “ yes . well , there _ is _ company there , i reckon . better give it up . ” 

 “ give it up , and i just leaving this country forever ! give it up and 
 maybe never have another chance . i tell you again , as i 've told you 
 before , i do n't care for her swag -- you may have it . but her husband was 
 rough on me -- many times he was rough on me -- and mainly he was the justice 
 of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant . and that ai n't all . it ai n't 
 a millionth part of it ! he had me _ horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in 
 front of the jail , like a nigger!--with all the town looking on ! 
 _ horsewhipped_!--do you understand ? he took advantage of me and died . but 
 i 'll take it out of _ her_. ” 

 “ oh , do n't kill her ! do n't do that ! ” 

 “ kill ? who said anything about killing ? i would kill _ him _ if he was 
 here ; but not her . when you want to get revenge on a woman you do n't 
 kill her -- bosh ! you go for her looks . you slit her nostrils -- you notch her 
 ears like a sow ! ” 

 “ by god , that's-- ” 

 “ keep your opinion to yourself ! it will be safest for you . i 'll tie her 
 to the bed . if she bleeds to death , is that my fault ? i 'll not cry , if 
 she does . my friend , you 'll help me in this thing -- for _ my _ sake -- that 's 
 why you 're here -- i might n't be able alone . if you flinch , i 'll kill you . 
 do you understand that ? and if i have to kill you , i 'll kill her -- and 
 then i reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business . ” 

 “ well , if it 's got to be done , let 's get at it . the quicker the 
 better -- i'm all in a shiver . ” 

 “ do it _ now _ ? and company there ? look here -- i'll get suspicious of you , 
 first thing you know . no -- we'll wait till the lights are out -- there 's no 
 hurry . ” 

 huck felt that a silence was going to ensue -- a thing still more awful 
 than any amount of murderous talk ; so he held his breath and stepped 
 gingerly back ; planted his foot carefully and firmly , after balancing , 
 one - legged , in a precarious way and almost toppling over , first on one 
 side and then on the other . he took another step back , with the same 
 elaboration and the same risks ; then another and another , and -- a twig 
 snapped under his foot ! his breath stopped and he listened . there was no 
 sound -- the stillness was perfect . his gratitude was measureless . now he 
 turned in his tracks , between the walls of sumach bushes -- turned 
 himself as carefully as if he were a ship -- and then stepped quickly but 
 cautiously along . when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure , and 
 so he picked up his nimble heels and flew . down , down he sped , till he 
 reached the welshman 's . he banged at the door , and presently the heads 
 of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows . 

 “ what 's the row there ? who 's banging ? what do you want ? ” 

 “ let me in -- quick ! i 'll tell everything . ” 

 “ why , who are you ? ” 

 “ huckleberry finn -- quick , let me in ! ” 

 “ huckleberry finn , indeed ! it ai n't a name to open many doors , i judge ! 
 but let him in , lads , and let 's see what 's the trouble . ” 

 “ please do n't ever tell i told you , ” were huck 's first words when he got 
 in . “ please don't -- i'd be killed , sure -- but the widow 's been good friends 
 to me sometimes , and i want to tell -- i _ will _ tell if you 'll promise you 
 wo n't ever say it was me . ” 

 “ by george , he _ has _ got something to tell , or he would n't act so ! ” 
  exclaimed the old man ; “ out with it and nobody here'll ever tell , lad . ” 

 three minutes later the old man and his sons , well armed , were up the 
 hill , and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe , their weapons in 
 their hands . huck accompanied them no further . he hid behind a great 
 bowlder and fell to listening . there was a lagging , anxious silence , and 
 then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry . 

 huck waited for no particulars . he sprang away and sped down the hill as 
 fast as his legs could carry him . 




 chapter xxx 

 as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning , huck came 
 groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshman 's door . the 
 inmates were asleep , but it was a sleep that was set on a hair - trigger , 
 on account of the exciting episode of the night . a call came from a 
 window : 

 “ who 's there ! ” 

 huck 's scared voice answered in a low tone : 

 “ please let me in ! it 's only huck finn ! ” 

 “ it 's a name that can open this door night or day , lad!--and welcome ! ” 

 these were strange words to the vagabond boy 's ears , and the pleasantest 
 he had ever heard . he could not recollect that the closing word had ever 
 been applied in his case before . the door was quickly unlocked , and he 
 entered . huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall 
 sons speedily dressed themselves . 

 “ now , my boy , i hope you 're good and hungry , because breakfast will be 
 ready as soon as the sun 's up , and we 'll have a piping hot one , too -- make 
 yourself easy about that ! i and the boys hoped you 'd turn up and stop 
 here last night . ” 

 “ i was awful scared , ” said huck , “ and i run . i took out when the pistols 
 went off , and i did n't stop for three mile . i 've come now becuz i wanted 
 to know about it , you know ; and i come before daylight becuz i did n't 
 want to run across them devils , even if they was dead . ” 

 “ well , poor chap , you do look as if you 'd had a hard night of it -- but 
 there 's a bed here for you when you 've had your breakfast . no , they 
 ai n't dead , lad -- we are sorry enough for that . you see we knew right 
 where to put our hands on them , by your description ; so we crept along 
 on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them -- dark as a cellar that 
 sumach path was -- and just then i found i was going to sneeze . it was the 
 meanest kind of luck ! i tried to keep it back , but no use--'twas bound to 
 come , and it did come ! i was in the lead with my pistol raised , and when 
 the sneeze started those scoundrels a - rustling to get out of the path , 
 i sung out , ' fire boys ! ' and blazed away at the place where the rustling 
 was . so did the boys . but they were off in a jiffy , those villains , and 
 we after them , down through the woods . i judge we never touched them . 
 they fired a shot apiece as they started , but their bullets whizzed by 
 and did n't do us any harm . as soon as we lost the sound of their feet 
 we quit chasing , and went down and stirred up the constables . they got a 
 posse together , and went off to guard the river bank , and as soon as it 
 is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods . my boys 
 will be with them presently . i wish we had some sort of description of 
 those rascals--'twould help a good deal . but you could n't see what they 
 were like , in the dark , lad , i suppose ? ” 

 “ oh yes ; i saw them downtown and follered them . ” 

 “ splendid ! describe them -- describe them , my boy ! ” 

 “ one 's the old deaf and dumb spaniard that 's ben around here once or 
 twice , and t'other 's a mean - looking , ragged-- ” 

 “ that 's enough , lad , we know the men ! happened on them in the woods back 
 of the widow 's one day , and they slunk away . off with you , boys , and 
 tell the sheriff -- get your breakfast tomorrow morning ! ” 

 the welshman 's sons departed at once . as they were leaving the room huck 
 sprang up and exclaimed : 

 “ oh , please do n't tell _ any_body it was me that blowed on them ! oh , 
 please ! ” 

 “ all right if you say it , huck , but you ought to have the credit of what 
 you did . ” 

 “ oh no , no ! please do n't tell ! ” 

 when the young men were gone , the old welshman said : 

 “ they wo n't tell -- and i wo n't . but why do n't you want it known ? ” 

 huck would not explain , further than to say that he already knew too 
 much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew 
 anything against him for the whole world -- he would be killed for knowing 
 it , sure . 

 the old man promised secrecy once more , and said : 

 “ how did you come to follow these fellows , lad ? were they looking 
 suspicious ? ” 

 huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply . then he said : 

 “ well , you see , i 'm a kind of a hard lot ,-- least everybody says so , and 
 i do n't see nothing agin it -- and sometimes i ca n't sleep much , on account 
 of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of 
 doing . that was the way of it last night . i could n't sleep , and so i 
 come along upstreet 'bout midnight , a - turning it all over , and when i 
 got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern , i backed 
 up agin the wall to have another think . well , just then along comes 
 these two chaps slipping along close by me , with something under their 
 arm , and i reckoned they 'd stole it . one was a - smoking , and t'other one 
 wanted a light ; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up 
 their faces and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard , 
 by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye , and t'other one was a 
 rusty , ragged - looking devil . ” 

 “ could you see the rags by the light of the cigars ? ” 

 this staggered huck for a moment . then he said : 

 “ well , i do n't know -- but somehow it seems as if i did . ” 

 “ then they went on , and you-- ” 

 “ follered ' em -- yes . that was it . i wanted to see what was up -- they sneaked 
 along so . i dogged 'em to the widder 's stile , and stood in the dark and 
 heard the ragged one beg for the widder , and the spaniard swear he 'd 
 spile her looks just as i told you and your two-- ” 

 “ what ! the _ deaf and dumb _ man said all that ! ” 

 huck had made another terrible mistake ! he was trying his best to keep 
 the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be , 
 and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of 
 all he could do . he made several efforts to creep out of his scrape , 
 but the old man 's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder . 
 presently the welshman said : 

 “ my boy , do n't be afraid of me . i would n't hurt a hair of your head for 
 all the world . no -- i'd protect you -- i'd protect you . this spaniard is 
 not deaf and dumb ; you 've let that slip without intending it ; you ca n't 
 cover that up now . you know something about that spaniard that you want 
 to keep dark . now trust me -- tell me what it is , and trust me -- i wo n't 
 betray you . ” 

 huck looked into the old man 's honest eyes a moment , then bent over and 
 whispered in his ear : 

 “ ' tain't a spaniard -- it 's injun joe ! ” 

 the welshman almost jumped out of his chair . in a moment he said : 

 “ it 's all plain enough , now . when you talked about notching ears and 
 slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment , because 
 white men do n't take that sort of revenge . but an injun ! that 's a 
 different matter altogether . ” 

 during breakfast the talk went on , and in the course of it the old man 
 said that the last thing which he and his sons had done , before going 
 to bed , was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for 
 marks of blood . they found none , but captured a bulky bundle of-- 

 “ of _ what _ ? ” 

 if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more 
 stunning suddenness from huck 's blanched lips . his eyes were staring 
 wide , now , and his breath suspended -- waiting for the answer . the welshman 
 started -- stared in return -- three seconds -- five seconds -- ten -- then replied : 

 “ of burglar 's tools . why , what 's the _ matter _ with you ? ” 

 huck sank back , panting gently , but deeply , unutterably grateful . the 
 welshman eyed him gravely , curiously -- and presently said : 

 “ yes , burglar 's tools . that appears to relieve you a good deal . but what 
 did give you that turn ? what were _ you _ expecting we 'd found ? ” 

 huck was in a close place -- the inquiring eye was upon him -- he would have 
 given anything for material for a plausible answer -- nothing suggested 
 itself -- the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper -- a senseless 
 reply offered -- there was no time to weigh it , so at a venture he uttered 
 it -- feebly : 

 “ sunday - school books , maybe . ” 

 poor huck was too distressed to smile , but the old man laughed loud and 
 joyously , shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot , and 
 ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a - man 's pocket , because 
 it cut down the doctor 's bill like everything . then he added : 

 “ poor old chap , you 're white and jaded -- you ai n't well a bit -- no wonder 
 you 're a little flighty and off your balance . but you 'll come out of it . 
 rest and sleep will fetch you out all right , i hope . ” 

 huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such 
 a suspicious excitement , for he had dropped the idea that the parcel 
 brought from the tavern was the treasure , as soon as he had heard the 
 talk at the widow 's stile . he had only thought it was not the treasure , 
 however -- he had not known that it wasn't -- and so the suggestion of a 
 captured bundle was too much for his self - possession . but on the whole 
 he felt glad the little episode had happened , for now he knew beyond all 
 question that that bundle was not _ the _ bundle , and so his mind was 
 at rest and exceedingly comfortable . in fact , everything seemed to be 
 drifting just in the right direction , now ; the treasure must be still 
 in no . 2 , the men would be captured and jailed that day , and he and 
 tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of 
 interruption . 

 just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door . huck 
 jumped for a hiding - place , for he had no mind to be connected even 
 remotely with the late event . the welshman admitted several ladies and 
 gentlemen , among them the widow douglas , and noticed that groups of 
 citizens were climbing up the hill -- to stare at the stile . so the news 
 had spread . the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the 
 visitors . the widow 's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken . 

 “ do n't say a word about it , madam . there 's another that you 're more 
 beholden to than you are to me and my boys , maybe , but he do n't allow me 
 to tell his name . we would n't have been there but for him . ” 

 of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the 
 main matter -- but the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his 
 visitors , and through them be transmitted to the whole town , for he 
 refused to part with his secret . when all else had been learned , the 
 widow said : 

 “ i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that 
 noise . why did n't you come and wake me ? ” 

 “ we judged it warn't worth while . those fellows warn't likely to come 
 again -- they had n't any tools left to work with , and what was the use of 
 waking you up and scaring you to death ? my three negro men stood guard 
 at your house all the rest of the night . they 've just come back . ” 

 more visitors came , and the story had to be told and retold for a couple 
 of hours more . 

 there was no sabbath - school during day - school vacation , but everybody 
 was early at church . the stirring event was well canvassed . news came 
 that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered . when the 
 sermon was finished , judge thatcher 's wife dropped alongside of mrs. 
 harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said : 

 “ is my becky going to sleep all day ? i just expected she would be tired 
 to death . ” 

 “ your becky ? ” 

 “ yes , ” with a startled look--“didn't she stay with you last night ? ” 

 “ why , no . ” 

 mrs. thatcher turned pale , and sank into a pew , just as aunt polly , 
 talking briskly with a friend , passed by . aunt polly said : 

 “ goodmorning , mrs. thatcher . goodmorning , mrs. harper . i 've got a boy 
 that 's turned up missing . i reckon my tom stayed at your house last 
 night -- one of you . and now he 's afraid to come to church . i 've got to 
 settle with him . ” 

 mrs. thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever . 

 “ he did n't stay with us , ” said mrs. harper , beginning to look uneasy . a 
 marked anxiety came into aunt polly 's face . 

 “ joe harper , have you seen my tom this morning ? ” 

 “ no'm . ” 

 “ when did you see him last ? ” 

 joe tried to remember , but was not sure he could say . the people had 
 stopped moving out of church . whispers passed along , and a boding 
 uneasiness took possession of every countenance . children were anxiously 
 questioned , and young teachers . they all said they had not noticed 
 whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip ; 
 it was dark ; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing . one 
 young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave ! 
 mrs. thatcher swooned away . aunt polly fell to crying and wringing her 
 hands . 

 the alarm swept from lip to lip , from group to group , from street to 
 street , and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and 
 the whole town was up ! the cardiff hill episode sank into instant 
 insignificance , the burglars were forgotten , horses were saddled , skiffs 
 were manned , the ferryboat ordered out , and before the horror was half 
 an hour old , two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward 
 the cave . 

 all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead . many women 
 visited aunt polly and mrs. thatcher and tried to comfort them . they 
 cried with them , too , and that was still better than words . all the 
 tedious night the town waited for news ; but when the morning dawned at 
 last , all the word that came was , “ send more candles -- and send food . ” 
  mrs. thatcher was almost crazed ; and aunt polly , also . judge thatcher 
 sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave , but they conveyed 
 no real cheer . 

 the old welshman came home toward daylight , spattered with 
 candle - grease , smeared with clay , and almost worn out . he found huck 
 still in the bed that had been provided for him , and delirious with 
 fever . the physicians were all at the cave , so the widow douglas came 
 and took charge of the patient . she said she would do her best by him , 
 because , whether he was good , bad , or indifferent , he was the lord 's , 
 and nothing that was the lord 's was a thing to be neglected . the 
 welshman said huck had good spots in him , and the widow said : 

 “ you can depend on it . that 's the lord 's mark . he do n't leave it off . 
 he never does . puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his 
 hands . ” 

 early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the 
 village , but the strongest of the citizens continued searching . all the 
 news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being 
 ransacked that had never been visited before ; that every corner and 
 crevice was going to be thoroughly searched ; that wherever one wandered 
 through the maze of passages , lights were to be seen flitting hither 
 and thither in the distance , and shoutings and pistol - shots sent their 
 hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles . in one place , 
 far from the section usually traversed by tourists , the names “ becky & 
 tom ” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle - smoke , and 
 near at hand a grease - soiled bit of ribbon . mrs. thatcher recognized the 
 ribbon and cried over it . she said it was the last relic she should ever 
 have of her child ; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so 
 precious , because this one parted latest from the living body before the 
 awful death came . some said that now and then , in the cave , a far - away 
 speck of light would glimmer , and then a glorious shout would burst 
 forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle -- and then a 
 sickening disappointment always followed ; the children were not there ; 
 it was only a searcher 's light . 

 three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along , and 
 the village sank into a hopeless stupor . no one had heart for anything . 
 the accidental discovery , just made , that the proprietor of the 
 temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises , scarcely fluttered the 
 public pulse , tremendous as the fact was . in a lucid interval , huck 
 feebly led up to the subject of taverns , and finally asked -- dimly 
 dreading the worst -- if anything had been discovered at the temperance 
 tavern since he had been ill . 

 “ yes , ” said the widow . 

 huck started up in bed , wildeyed : 

 “ what ? what was it ? ” 

 “ liquor!--and the place has been shut up . lie down , child -- what a turn you 
 did give me ! ” 

 “ only tell me just one thing -- only just one -- please ! was it tom sawyer 
 that found it ? ” 

 the widow burst into tears . “ hush , hush , child , hush ! i 've told you 
 before , you must _ not _ talk . you are very , very sick ! ” 

 then nothing but liquor had been found ; there would have been a great 
 powwow if it had been the gold . so the treasure was gone forever -- gone 
 forever ! but what could she be crying about ? curious that she should 
 cry . 

 these thoughts worked their dim way through huck 's mind , and under the 
 weariness they gave him he fell asleep . the widow said to herself : 

 “ there -- he 's asleep , poor wreck . tom sawyer find it ! pity but somebody 
 could find tom sawyer ! ah , there ai n't many left , now , that 's got hope 
 enough , or strength enough , either , to go on searching . ” 




 chapter xxxi 

 now to return to tom and becky 's share in the picnic . they tripped along 
 the murky aisles with the rest of the company , visiting the familiar 
 wonders of the cave -- wonders dubbed with rather over - descriptive names , 
 such as “ the drawing - room , ” “ the cathedral , ” “ aladdin 's palace , ” and 
 so on . presently the hide - and - seek frolicking began , and tom and becky 
 engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle 
 wearisome ; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their 
 candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names , dates , 
 postoffice addresses , and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been 
 frescoed ( in candle - smoke ) . still drifting along and talking , they 
 scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls 
 were not frescoed . they smoked their own names under an overhanging 
 shelf and moved on . presently they came to a place where a little stream 
 of water , trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with 
 it , had , in the slow - dragging ages , formed a laced and ruffled niagara 
 in gleaming and imperishable stone . tom squeezed his small body behind 
 it in order to illuminate it for becky 's gratification . he found that 
 it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between 
 narrow walls , and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him . 

 becky responded to his call , and they made a smoke - mark for future 
 guidance , and started upon their quest . they wound this way and that , 
 far down into the secret depths of the cave , made another mark , and 
 branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about . in 
 one place they found a spacious cavern , from whose ceiling depended a 
 multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of 
 a man 's leg ; they walked all about it , wondering and admiring , and 
 presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into 
 it . this shortly brought them to a bewitching spring , whose basin was 
 incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals ; it was in the midst 
 of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which 
 had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites 
 together , the result of the ceaseless water - drip of centuries . under the 
 roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together , thousands in a 
 bunch ; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by 
 hundreds , squeaking and darting furiously at the candles . tom knew their 
 ways and the danger of this sort of conduct . he seized becky 's hand and 
 hurried her into the first corridor that offered ; and none too soon , for 
 a bat struck becky 's light out with its wing while she was passing out 
 of the cavern . the bats chased the children a good distance ; but the 
 fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered , and at last got 
 rid of the perilous things . tom found a subterranean lake , shortly , 
 which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the 
 shadows . he wanted to explore its borders , but concluded that it would 
 be best to sit down and rest awhile , first . now , for the first time , the 
 deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the 
 children . becky said : 

 “ why , i did n't notice , but it seems ever so long since i heard any of 
 the others . ” 

 “ come to think , becky , we are away down below them -- and i do n't know how 
 far away north , or south , or east , or whichever it is . we could n't hear 
 them here . ” 

 becky grew apprehensive . 

 “ i wonder how long we 've been down here , tom ? we better start back . ” 

 “ yes , i reckon we better . p'raps we better . ” 

 “ can you find the way , tom ? it 's all a mixed - up crookedness to me . ” 

 “ i reckon i could find it -- but then the bats . if they put our candles 
 out it will be an awful fix . let 's try some other way , so as not to go 
 through there . ” 

 “ well . but i hope we wo n't get lost . it would be so awful ! ” and the girl 
 shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities . 

 they started through a corridor , and traversed it in silence a long 
 way , glancing at each new opening , to see if there was anything familiar 
 about the look of it ; but they were all strange . every time tom made an 
 examination , becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign , and he 
 would say cheerily : 

 “ oh , it 's all right . this ai n't the one , but we 'll come to it right 
 away ! ” 

 but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure , and presently began 
 to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random , in desperate hope of 
 finding the one that was wanted . he still said it was “ all right , ” but 
 there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their 
 ring and sounded just as if he had said , “ all is lost ! ” becky clung to 
 his side in an anguish of fear , and tried hard to keep back the tears , 
 but they would come . at last she said : 

 “ oh , tom , never mind the bats , let 's go back that way ! we seem to get 
 worse and worse off all the time . ” 

 “ listen ! ” said he . 

 profound silence ; silence so deep that even their breathings were 
 conspicuous in the hush . tom shouted . the call went echoing down 
 the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that 
 resembled a ripple of mocking laughter . 

 “ oh , do n't do it again , tom , it is too horrid , ” said becky . 

 “ it is horrid , but i better , becky ; they might hear us , you know , ” and 
 he shouted again . 

 the “ might ” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter , it so 
 confessed a perishing hope . the children stood still and listened ; but 
 there was no result . tom turned upon the back track at once , and hurried 
 his steps . it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his 
 manner revealed another fearful fact to becky -- he could not find his way 
 back ! 

 “ oh , tom , you did n't make any marks ! ” 

 “ becky , i was such a fool ! such a fool ! i never thought we might want to 
 come back ! no -- i ca n't find the way . it 's all mixed up . ” 

 “ tom , tom , we 're lost ! we 're lost ! we never can get out of this awful 
 place ! oh , why _ did _ we ever leave the others ! ” 

 she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom 
 was appalled with the idea that she might die , or lose her reason . he 
 sat down by her and put his arms around her ; she buried her face in 
 his bosom , she clung to him , she poured out her terrors , her unavailing 
 regrets , and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter . tom 
 begged her to pluck up hope again , and she said she could not . he fell 
 to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable 
 situation ; this had a better effect . she said she would try to hope 
 again , she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he 
 would not talk like that any more . for he was no more to blame than she , 
 she said . 

 so they moved on again -- aimlessly -- simply at random -- all they could do 
 was to move , keep moving . for a little while , hope made a show of 
 reviving -- not with any reason to back it , but only because it is its 
 nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and 
 familiarity with failure . 

 by - and - by tom took becky 's candle and blew it out . this economy meant so 
 much ! words were not needed . becky understood , and her hope died again . 
 she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his 
 pockets -- yet he must economize . 

 by - and - by , fatigue began to assert its claims ; the children tried to pay 
 attention , for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was 
 grown to be so precious , moving , in some direction , in any direction , 
 was at least progress and might bear fruit ; but to sit down was to 
 invite death and shorten its pursuit . 

 at last becky 's frail limbs refused to carry her farther . she sat down . 
 tom rested with her , and they talked of home , and the friends there , 
 and the comfortable beds and , above all , the light ! becky cried , and tom 
 tried to think of some way of comforting her , but all his encouragements 
 were grown thread - bare with use , and sounded like sarcasms . fatigue bore 
 so heavily upon becky that she drowsed off to sleep . tom was grateful . 
 he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural 
 under the influence of pleasant dreams ; and by - and - by a smile dawned and 
 rested there . the peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing 
 into his own spirit , and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and 
 dreamy memories . while he was deep in his musings , becky woke up with a 
 breezy little laugh -- but it was stricken dead upon her lips , and a groan 
 followed it . 

 “ oh , how _ could _ i sleep ! i wish i never , never had waked ! no ! no , i 
 do n't , tom ! do n't look so ! i wo n't say it again . ” 

 “ i 'm glad you 've slept , becky ; you 'll feel rested , now , and we 'll find 
 the way out . ” 

 “ we can try , tom ; but i 've seen such a beautiful country in my dream . i 
 reckon we are going there . ” 

 “ maybe not , maybe not . cheer up , becky , and let 's go on trying . ” 

 they rose up and wandered along , hand in hand and hopeless . they tried 
 to estimate how long they had been in the cave , but all they knew was 
 that it seemed days and weeks , and yet it was plain that this could not 
 be , for their candles were not gone yet . a long time after this -- they 
 could not tell how long -- tom said they must go softly and listen for 
 dripping water -- they must find a spring . they found one presently , and 
 tom said it was time to rest again . both were cruelly tired , yet becky 
 said she thought she could go a little farther . she was surprised to 
 hear tom dissent . she could not understand it . they sat down , and tom 
 fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay . thought 
 was soon busy ; nothing was said for some time . then becky broke the 
 silence : 

 “ tom , i am so hungry ! ” 

 tom took something out of his pocket . 

 “ do you remember this ? ” said he . 

 becky almost smiled . 

 “ it 's our wedding - cake , tom . ” 

 “ yes -- i wish it was as big as a barrel , for it 's all we 've got . ” 

 “ i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on , tom , the way grownup 
 people do with wedding - cake -- but it 'll be our-- ” 

 she dropped the sentence where it was . tom divided the cake and becky 
 ate with good appetite , while tom nibbled at his moiety . there was 
 abundance of cold water to finish the feast with . by - and - by becky 
 suggested that they move on again . tom was silent a moment . then he 
 said : 

 “ becky , can you bear it if i tell you something ? ” 

 becky 's face paled , but she thought she could . 

 “ well , then , becky , we must stay here , where there 's water to drink . 
 that little piece is our last candle ! ” 

 becky gave loose to tears and wailings . tom did what he could to comfort 
 her , but with little effect . at length becky said : 

 “ tom ! ” 

 “ well , becky ? ” 

 “ they 'll miss us and hunt for us ! ” 

 “ yes , they will ! certainly they will ! ” 

 “ maybe they 're hunting for us now , tom . ” 

 “ why , i reckon maybe they are . i hope they are . ” 

 “ when would they miss us , tom ? ” 

 “ when they get back to the boat , i reckon . ” 

 “ tom , it might be dark then -- would they notice we had n't come ? ” 

 “ i do n't know . but anyway , your mother would miss you as soon as they 
 got home . ” 

 a frightened look in becky 's face brought tom to his senses and he saw 
 that he had made a blunder . becky was not to have gone home that night ! 
 the children became silent and thoughtful . in a moment a new burst of 
 grief from becky showed tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers 
 also -- that the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs. thatcher 
 discovered that becky was not at mrs. harper 's . 

 the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it 
 melt slowly and pitilessly away ; saw the half inch of wick stand alone 
 at last ; saw the feeble flame rise and fall , climb the thin column of 
 smoke , linger at its top a moment , and then -- the horror of utter darkness 
 reigned ! 

 how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that 
 she was crying in tom 's arms , neither could tell . all that they knew 
 was , that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time , both awoke out of 
 a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more . tom said 
 it might be sunday , now -- maybe monday . he tried to get becky to talk , but 
 her sorrows were too oppressive , all her hopes were gone . tom said that 
 they must have been missed long ago , and no doubt the search was going 
 on . he would shout and maybe some one would come . he tried it ; but in 
 the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no 
 more . 

 the hours wasted away , and hunger came to torment the captives again . a 
 portion of tom 's half of the cake was left ; they divided and ate it . but 
 they seemed hungrier than before . the poor morsel of food only whetted 
 desire . 

 by - and - by tom said : 

 “ sh ! did you hear that ? ” 

 both held their breath and listened . there was a sound like the 
 faintest , far - off shout . instantly tom answered it , and leading becky by 
 the hand , started groping down the corridor in its direction . presently 
 he listened again ; again the sound was heard , and apparently a little 
 nearer . 

 “ it 's them ! ” said tom ; “ they 're coming ! come along , becky -- we're all 
 right now ! ” 

 the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming . their speed was slow , 
 however , because pitfalls were somewhat common , and had to be guarded 
 against . they shortly came to one and had to stop . it might be three 
 feet deep , it might be a hundred -- there was no passing it at any rate . 
 tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could . no 
 bottom . they must stay there and wait until the searchers came . they 
 listened ; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant ! 
 a moment or two more and they had gone altogether . the heart - sinking 
 misery of it ! tom whooped until he was hoarse , but it was of no use . he 
 talked hopefully to becky ; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no 
 sounds came again . 

 the children groped their way back to the spring . the weary time dragged 
 on ; they slept again , and awoke famished and woe - stricken . tom believed 
 it must be tuesday by this time . 

 now an idea struck him . there were some side passages near at hand . it 
 would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the 
 heavy time in idleness . he took a kite - line from his pocket , tied it to 
 a projection , and he and becky started , tom in the lead , unwinding the 
 line as he groped along . at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended 
 in a “ jumping - off place . ” tom got down on his knees and felt below , 
 and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands 
 conveniently ; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the 
 right , and at that moment , not twenty yards away , a human hand , holding 
 a candle , appeared from behind a rock ! tom lifted up a glorious shout , 
 and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to -- injun 
 joe 's ! tom was paralyzed ; he could not move . he was vastly gratified the 
 next moment , to see the “ spaniard ” take to his heels and get himself out 
 of sight . tom wondered that joe had not recognized his voice and come 
 over and killed him for testifying in court . but the echoes must have 
 disguised the voice . without doubt , that was it , he reasoned . tom 's 
 fright weakened every muscle in his body . he said to himself that if he 
 had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there , and 
 nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe again . he 
 was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen . he told her he 
 had only shouted “ for luck . ” 

 but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run . 
 another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought 
 changes . the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger . tom believed 
 that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday , now , 
 and that the search had been given over . he proposed to explore another 
 passage . he felt willing to risk injun joe and all other terrors . but 
 becky was very weak . she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be 
 roused . she said she would wait , now , where she was , and die -- it would 
 not be long . she told tom to go with the kite - line and explore if he 
 chose ; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak 
 to her ; and she made him promise that when the awful time came , he would 
 stay by her and hold her hand until all was over . 

 tom kissed her , with a choking sensation in his throat , and made a show 
 of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave ; 
 then he took the kite - line in his hand and went groping down one of the 
 passages on his hands and knees , distressed with hunger and sick with 
 bodings of coming doom . 




 chapter xxxii 

 tuesday afternoon came , and waned to the twilight . the village of st. 
 petersburg still mourned . the lost children had not been found . public 
 prayers had been offered up for them , and many and many a private prayer 
 that had the petitioner 's whole heart in it ; but still no good news came 
 from the cave . the majority of the searchers had given up the quest 
 and gone back to their daily avocations , saying that it was plain the 
 children could never be found . mrs. thatcher was very ill , and a great 
 part of the time delirious . people said it was heartbreaking to hear her 
 call her child , and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time , 
 then lay it wearily down again with a moan . aunt polly had drooped into 
 a settled melancholy , and her gray hair had grown almost white . the 
 village went to its rest on tuesday night , sad and forlorn . 

 away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village 
 bells , and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half - clad 
 people , who shouted , “ turn out ! turn out ! they 're found ! they 're found ! ” 
  tin pans and horns were added to the din , the population massed itself 
 and moved toward the river , met the children coming in an open carriage 
 drawn by shouting citizens , thronged around it , joined its homeward 
 march , and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after 
 huzzah ! 

 the village was illuminated ; nobody went to bed again ; it was the 
 greatest night the little town had ever seen . during the first half - hour 
 a procession of villagers filed through judge thatcher 's house , seized 
 the saved ones and kissed them , squeezed mrs. thatcher 's hand , tried to 
 speak but couldn't -- and drifted out raining tears all over the place . 

 aunt polly 's happiness was complete , and mrs. thatcher 's nearly so . it 
 would be complete , however , as soon as the messenger dispatched with the 
 great news to the cave should get the word to her husband . tom lay upon 
 a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the 
 wonderful adventure , putting in many striking additions to adorn it 
 withal ; and closed with a description of how he left becky and went 
 on an exploring expedition ; how he followed two avenues as far as his 
 kite - line would reach ; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch 
 of the kite - line , and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far - off 
 speck that looked like daylight ; dropped the line and groped toward it , 
 pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole , and saw the broad 
 mississippi rolling by ! 

 and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that 
 speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more ! he 
 told how he went back for becky and broke the good news and she told 
 him not to fret her with such stuff , for she was tired , and knew she was 
 going to die , and wanted to . he described how he labored with her and 
 convinced her ; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to 
 where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight ; how he pushed his way 
 out at the hole and then helped her out ; how they sat there and cried 
 for gladness ; how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed them 
 and told them their situation and their famished condition ; how the men 
 did n't believe the wild tale at first , “ because , ” said they , “ you are 
 five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”--then took 
 them aboard , rowed to a house , gave them supper , made them rest till two 
 or three hours after dark and then brought them home . 

 before day - dawn , judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him 
 were tracked out , in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind 
 them , and informed of the great news . 

 three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to 
 be shaken off at once , as tom and becky soon discovered . they were 
 bedridden all of wednesday and thursday , and seemed to grow more and 
 more tired and worn , all the time . tom got about , a little , on thursday , 
 was downtown friday , and nearly as whole as ever saturday ; but becky 
 did not leave her room until sunday , and then she looked as if she had 
 passed through a wasting illness . 

 tom learned of huck 's sickness and went to see him on friday , but could 
 not be admitted to the bedroom ; neither could he on saturday or sunday . 
 he was admitted daily after that , but was warned to keep still about his 
 adventure and introduce no exciting topic . the widow douglas stayed by 
 to see that he obeyed . at home tom learned of the cardiff hill event ; 
 also that the “ ragged man 's ” body had eventually been found in the river 
 near the ferry - landing ; he had been drowned while trying to escape , 
 perhaps . 

 about a fortnight after tom 's rescue from the cave , he started off to 
 visit huck , who had grown plenty strong enough , now , to hear exciting 
 talk , and tom had some that would interest him , he thought . judge 
 thatcher 's house was on tom 's way , and he stopped to see becky . the 
 judge and some friends set tom to talking , and some one asked him 
 ironically if he would n't like to go to the cave again . tom said he 
 thought he would n't mind it . the judge said : 

 “ well , there are others just like you , tom , i 've not the least doubt . 
 but we have taken care of that . nobody will get lost in that cave any 
 more . ” 

 “ why ? ” 

 “ because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago , and 
 triple - locked -- and i 've got the keys . ” 

 tom turned as white as a sheet . 

 “ what 's the matter , boy ! here , run , somebody ! fetch a glass of water ! ” 

 the water was brought and thrown into tom 's face . 

 “ ah , now you 're all right . what was the matter with you , tom ? ” 

 “ oh , judge , injun joe 's in the cave ! ” 




 chapter xxxiii 

 within a few minutes the news had spread , and a dozen skiff - loads of 
 men were on their way to mcdougal 's cave , and the ferryboat , well filled 
 with passengers , soon followed . tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore 
 judge thatcher . 

 when the cave door was unlocked , a sorrowful sight presented itself in 
 the dim twilight of the place . injun joe lay stretched upon the ground , 
 dead , with his face close to the crack of the door , as if his longing 
 eyes had been fixed , to the latest moment , upon the light and the cheer 
 of the free world outside . tom was touched , for he knew by his own 
 experience how this wretch had suffered . his pity was moved , but 
 nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security , now , 
 which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated 
 before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day 
 he lifted his voice against this bloody - minded outcast . 

 injun joe 's bowie - knife lay close by , its blade broken in two . the great 
 foundation - beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through , with 
 tedious labor ; useless labor , too , it was , for the native rock formed a 
 sill outside it , and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought 
 no effect ; the only damage done was to the knife itself . but if there 
 had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless 
 still , for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have 
 squeezed his body under the door , and he knew it . so he had only hacked 
 that place in order to be doing something -- in order to pass the weary 
 time -- in order to employ his tortured faculties . ordinarily one could 
 find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this 
 vestibule , left there by tourists ; but there were none now . the prisoner 
 had searched them out and eaten them . he had also contrived to catch a 
 few bats , and these , also , he had eaten , leaving only their claws . the 
 poor unfortunate had starved to death . in one place , near at hand , a 
 stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages , builded 
 by the water - drip from a stalactite overhead . the captive had broken off 
 the stalagmite , and upon the stump had placed a stone , wherein he had 
 scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once 
 in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock - tick -- a 
 dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours . that drop was falling 
 when the pyramids were new ; when troy fell ; when the foundations of rome 
 were laid ; when christ was crucified ; when the conqueror created the 
 british empire ; when columbus sailed ; when the massacre at lexington was 
 “ news . ” 

 it is falling now ; it will still be falling when all these things shall 
 have sunk down the afternoon of history , and the twilight of tradition , 
 and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion . has everything a 
 purpose and a mission ? did this drop fall patiently during five thousand 
 years to be ready for this flitting human insect 's need ? and has it 
 another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come ? no 
 matter . it is many and many a year since the hapless half - breed scooped 
 out the stone to catch the priceless drops , but to this day the tourist 
 stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow - dropping water when 
 he comes to see the wonders of mcdougal 's cave . injun joe 's cup stands 
 first in the list of the cavern 's marvels ; even “ aladdin 's palace ” 
  can not rival it . 

 injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave ; and people flocked 
 there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and 
 hamlets for seven miles around ; they brought their children , and 
 all sorts of provisions , and confessed that they had had almost as 
 satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the 
 hanging . 

 this funeral stopped the further growth of one thing -- the petition to the 
 governor for injun joe 's pardon . the petition had been largely signed ; 
 many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held , and a committee of 
 sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the 
 governor , and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty 
 under foot . injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the 
 village , but what of that ? if he had been satan himself there would 
 have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a 
 pardon - petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired 
 and leaky water - works . 

 the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have 
 an important talk . huck had learned all about tom 's adventure from the 
 welshman and the widow douglas , by this time , but tom said he reckoned 
 there was one thing they had not told him ; that thing was what he wanted 
 to talk about now . huck 's face saddened . he said : 

 “ i know what it is . you got into no . 2 and never found anything but 
 whiskey . nobody told me it was you ; but i just knowed it must ' a ' ben 
 you , soon as i heard 'bout that whiskey business ; and i knowed you 
 had n't got the money becuz you 'd ' a ' got at me some way or other and 
 told me even if you was mum to everybody else . tom , something 's always 
 told me we 'd never get holt of that swag . ” 

 “ why , huck , i never told on that tavern - keeper . _ you _ know his tavern 
 was all right the saturday i went to the picnic . do n't you remember you 
 was to watch there that night ? ” 

 “ oh yes ! why , it seems 'bout a year ago . it was that very night that i 
 follered injun joe to the widder 's . ” 

 “ _ you _ followed him ? ” 

 “ yes -- but you keep mum . i reckon injun joe 's left friends behind him , and 
 i do n't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks . if it had n't 
 ben for me he 'd be down in texas now , all right . ” 

 then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom , who had only 
 heard of the welshman 's part of it before . 

 “ well , ” said huck , presently , coming back to the main question , “ whoever 
 nipped the whiskey in no . 2 , nipped the money , too , i reckon -- anyways 
 it 's a goner for us , tom . ” 

 “ huck , that money was n't ever in no . 2 ! ” 

 “ what ! ” huck searched his comrade 's face keenly . “ tom , have you got on 
 the track of that money again ? ” 

 “ huck , it 's in the cave ! ” 

 huck 's eyes blazed . 

 “ say it again , tom . ” 

 “ the money 's in the cave ! ” 

 “ tom -- honest injun , now -- is it fun , or earnest ? ” 

 “ earnest , huck -- just as earnest as ever i was in my life . will you go in 
 there with me and help get it out ? ” 

 “ i bet i will ! i will if it 's where we can blaze our way to it and not 
 get lost . ” 

 “ huck , we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the 
 world . ” 

 “ good as wheat ! what makes you think the money's-- ” 

 “ huck , you just wait till we get in there . if we do n't find it i 'll 
 agree to give you my drum and every thing i 've got in the world . i will , 
 by jings . ” 

 “ all right -- it 's a whiz . when do you say ? ” 

 “ right now , if you say it . are you strong enough ? ” 

 “ is it far in the cave ? i ben on my pins a little , three or four days , 
 now , but i ca n't walk more'n a mile , tom -- least i do n't think i could . ” 

 “ it 's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go , huck , 
 but there 's a mighty short cut that they do n't anybody but me know 
 about . huck , i 'll take you right to it in a skiff . i 'll float the skiff 
 down there , and i 'll pull it back again all by myself . you need n't ever 
 turn your hand over . ” 

 “ less start right off , tom . ” 

 “ all right . we want some bread and meat , and our pipes , and a little 
 bag or two , and two or three kite - strings , and some of these new - fangled 
 things they call lucifer matches . i tell you , many 's the time i wished i 
 had some when i was in there before . ” 

 a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who 
 was absent , and got under way at once . when they were several miles 
 below “ cave hollow , ” tom said : 

 “ now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the 
 cave hollow -- no houses , no wood - yards , bushes all alike . but do you see 
 that white place up yonder where there 's been a landslide ? well , that 's 
 one of my marks . we 'll get ashore , now . ” 

 they landed . 

 “ now , huck , where we 're a - standing you could touch that hole i got out 
 of with a fishing - pole . see if you can find it . ” 

 huck searched all the place about , and found nothing . tom proudly 
 marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said : 

 “ here you are ! look at it , huck ; it 's the snuggest hole in this country . 
 you just keep mum about it . all along i 've been wanting to be a robber , 
 but i knew i 'd got to have a thing like this , and where to run across 
 it was the bother . we 've got it now , and we 'll keep it quiet , only we 'll 
 let joe harper and ben rogers in -- because of course there 's got to be a 
 gang , or else there would n't be any style about it . tom sawyer 's gang -- it 
 sounds splendid , do n't it , huck ? ” 

 “ well , it just does , tom . and who 'll we rob ? ” 

 “ oh , most anybody . waylay people -- that 's mostly the way . ” 

 “ and kill them ? ” 

 “ no , not always . hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom . ” 

 “ what 's a ransom ? ” 

 “ money . you make them raise all they can , off'n their friends ; and after 
 you 've kept them a year , if it ai n't raised then you kill them . that 's 
 the general way . only you do n't kill the women . you shut up the women , 
 but you do n't kill them . they 're always beautiful and rich , and awfully 
 scared . you take their watches and things , but you always take your hat 
 off and talk polite . they ai n't anybody as polite as robbers -- you'll see 
 that in any book . well , the women get to loving you , and after they 've 
 been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that 
 you could n't get them to leave . if you drove them out they 'd turn right 
 around and come back . it 's so in all the books . ” 

 “ why , it 's real bully , tom . i believe it 's better'n to be a pirate . ” 

 “ yes , it 's better in some ways , because it 's close to home and circuses 
 and all that . ” 

 by this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole , tom in 
 the lead . they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel , then 
 made their spliced kite - strings fast and moved on . a few steps brought 
 them to the spring , and tom felt a shudder quiver all through him . 
 he showed huck the fragment of candle - wick perched on a lump of clay 
 against the wall , and described how he and becky had watched the flame 
 struggle and expire . 

 the boys began to quiet down to whispers , now , for the stillness and 
 gloom of the place oppressed their spirits . they went on , and presently 
 entered and followed tom 's other corridor until they reached the 
 “ jumping - off place . ” the candles revealed the fact that it was not 
 really a precipice , but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet 
 high . tom whispered : 

 “ now i 'll show you something , huck . ” 

 he held his candle aloft and said : 

 “ look as far around the corner as you can . do you see that ? there -- on the 
 big rock over yonder -- done with candle - smoke . ” 

 “ tom , it 's a _ cross _ ! ” 

 “ _ now _ where 's your number two ? ' _ under the cross _ , ' hey ? right yonder 's 
 where i saw injun joe poke up his candle , huck ! ” 

 huck stared at the mystic sign awhile , and then said with a shaky voice : 

 “ tom , less git out of here ! ” 

 “ what ! and leave the treasure ? ” 

 “ yes -- leave it . injun joe 's ghost is round about there , certain . ” 

 “ no it ai n't , huck , no it ai n't . it would ha'nt the place where he 
 died -- away out at the mouth of the cave -- five mile from here . ” 

 “ no , tom , it would n't . it would hang round the money . i know the ways of 
 ghosts , and so do you . ” 

 tom began to fear that huck was right . mis - givings gathered in his mind . 
 but presently an idea occurred to him-- 

 “ lookyhere , huck , what fools we 're making of ourselves ! injun joe 's 
 ghost ai n't a going to come around where there 's a cross ! ” 

 the point was well taken . it had its effect . 

 “ tom , i did n't think of that . but that 's so . it 's luck for us , that 
 cross is . i reckon we 'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box . ” 

 tom went first , cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended . 
 huck followed . four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the 
 great rock stood in . the boys examined three of them with no result . 
 they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock , with 
 a pallet of blankets spread down in it ; also an old suspender , some 
 bacon rind , and the well - gnawed bones of two or three fowls . but there 
 was no moneybox . the lads searched and researched this place , but in 
 vain . tom said : 

 “ he said _ under _ the cross . well , this comes nearest to being under the 
 cross . it ca n't be under the rock itself , because that sets solid on the 
 ground . ” 

 they searched everywhere once more , and then sat down discouraged . huck 
 could suggest nothing . by - and - by tom said : 

 “ lookyhere , huck , there 's footprints and some candle - grease on the clay 
 about one side of this rock , but not on the other sides . now , what 's 
 that for ? i bet you the money _ is _ under the rock . i 'm going to dig in 
 the clay . ” 

 “ that ai n't no bad notion , tom ! ” said huck with animation . 

 tom 's “ real barlow ” was out at once , and he had not dug four inches 
 before he struck wood . 

 “ hey , huck!--you hear that ? ” 

 huck began to dig and scratch now . some boards were soon uncovered and 
 removed . they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock . 
 tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he 
 could , but said he could not see to the end of the rift . he proposed 
 to explore . he stooped and passed under ; the narrow way descended 
 gradually . he followed its winding course , first to the right , then to 
 the left , huck at his heels . tom turned a short curve , by - and - by , and 
 exclaimed : 

 “ my goodness , huck , lookyhere ! ” 

 it was the treasure - box , sure enough , occupying a snug little cavern , 
 along with an empty powder - keg , a couple of guns in leather cases , two 
 or three pairs of old moccasins , a leather belt , and some other rubbish 
 well soaked with the water - drip . 

 “ got it at last ! ” said huck , ploughing among the tarnished coins with 
 his hand . “ my , but we 're rich , tom ! ” 

 “ huck , i always reckoned we 'd get it . it 's just too good to believe , but 
 we _ have _ got it , sure ! say -- let 's not fool around here . let 's snake it 
 out . lemme see if i can lift the box . ” 

 it weighed about fifty pounds . tom could lift it , after an awkward 
 fashion , but could not carry it conveniently . 

 “ i thought so , ” he said ; “ _ they _ carried it like it was heavy , that day 
 at the ha'nted house . i noticed that . i reckon i was right to think of 
 fetching the little bags along . ” 

 the money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross 
 rock . 

 “ now less fetch the guns and things , ” said huck . 

 “ no , huck -- leave them there . they 're just the tricks to have when we 
 go to robbing . we 'll keep them there all the time , and we 'll hold our 
 orgies there , too . it 's an awful snug place for orgies . ” 

 “ what orgies ? ” 

 “ i dono . but robbers always have orgies , and of course we 've got to 
 have them , too . come along , huck , we 've been in here a long time . it 's 
 getting late , i reckon . i 'm hungry , too . we 'll eat and smoke when we get 
 to the skiff . ” 

 they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes , looked warily 
 out , found the coast clear , and were soon lunching and smoking in the 
 skiff . as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got 
 under way . tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight , chatting 
 cheerily with huck , and landed shortly after dark . 

 “ now , huck , ” said tom , “ we 'll hide the money in the loft of the widow 's 
 woodshed , and i 'll come up in the morning and we 'll count it and divide , 
 and then we 'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be 
 safe . just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till i run and hook 
 benny taylor 's little wagon ; i wo n't be gone a minute . ” 

 he disappeared , and presently returned with the wagon , put the two small 
 sacks into it , threw some old rags on top of them , and started off , 
 dragging his cargo behind him . when the boys reached the welshman 's 
 house , they stopped to rest . just as they were about to move on , the 
 welshman stepped out and said : 

 “ hallo , who 's that ? ” 

 “ huck and tom sawyer . ” 

 “ good ! come along with me , boys , you are keeping everybody waiting . 
 here -- hurry up , trot ahead -- i'll haul the wagon for you . why , it 's not as 
 light as it might be . got bricks in it ?-- or old metal ? ” 

 “ old metal , ” said tom . 

 “ i judged so ; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away 
 more time hunting up six bits ' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry 
 than they would to make twice the money at regular work . but that 's 
 human nature -- hurry along , hurry along ! ” 

 the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about . 

 “ never mind ; you 'll see , when we get to the widow douglas ' . ” 

 huck said with some apprehension -- for he was long used to being falsely 
 accused : 

 “ mr. jones , we have n't been doing nothing . ” 

 the welshman laughed . 

 “ well , i do n't know , huck , my boy . i do n't know about that . ai n't you 
 and the widow good friends ? ” 

 “ yes . well , she 's ben good friends to me , anyway . ” 

 “ all right , then . what do you want to be afraid for ? ” 

 this question was not entirely answered in huck 's slow mind before he 
 found himself pushed , along with tom , into mrs. douglas ' drawing - room . 
 mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed . 

 the place was grandly lighted , and everybody that was of any consequence 
 in the village was there . the thatchers were there , the harpers , the 
 rogerses , aunt polly , sid , mary , the minister , the editor , and a great 
 many more , and all dressed in their best . the widow received the boys 
 as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings . they 
 were covered with clay and candle - grease . aunt polly blushed crimson 
 with humiliation , and frowned and shook her head at tom . nobody suffered 
 half as much as the two boys did , however . mr. jones said : 

 “ tom was n't at home , yet , so i gave him up ; but i stumbled on him and 
 huck right at my door , and so i just brought them along in a hurry . ” 

 “ and you did just right , ” said the widow . “ come with me , boys . ” 

 she took them to a bedchamber and said : 

 “ now wash and dress yourselves . here are two new suits of 
 clothes -- shirts , socks , everything complete . they 're huck's -- no , no 
 thanks , huck -- mr . jones bought one and i the other . but they 'll fit both 
 of you . get into them . we 'll wait -- come down when you are slicked up 
 enough . ” 

 then she left . 




 chapter xxxiv 

 huck said : “ tom , we can slope , if we can find a rope . the window ai n't 
 high from the ground . ” 

 “ shucks ! what do you want to slope for ? ” 

 “ well , i ai n't used to that kind of a crowd . i ca n't stand it . i ai n't 
 going down there , tom . ” 

 “ oh , bother ! it ai n't anything . i do n't mind it a bit . i 'll take care of 
 you . ” 

 sid appeared . 

 “ tom , ” said he , “ auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon . mary 
 got your sunday clothes ready , and everybody 's been fretting about you . 
 say -- ain't this grease and clay , on your clothes ? ” 

 “ now , mr. siddy , you jist ' tend to your own business . what 's all this 
 blowout about , anyway ? ” 

 “ it 's one of the widow 's parties that she 's always having . this time 
 it 's for the welshman and his sons , on account of that scrape they 
 helped her out of the other night . and say -- i can tell you something , if 
 you want to know . ” 

 “ well , what ? ” 

 “ why , old mr. jones is going to try to spring something on the people 
 here tonight , but i overheard him tell auntie today about it , as a 
 secret , but i reckon it 's not much of a secret now . everybody knows -- the 
 widow , too , for all she tries to let on she do n't . mr. jones was bound 
 huck should be here -- couldn't get along with his grand secret without 
 huck , you know ! ” 

 “ secret about what , sid ? ” 

 “ about huck tracking the robbers to the widow 's . i reckon mr. jones was 
 going to make a grand time over his surprise , but i bet you it will drop 
 pretty flat . ” 

 sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way . 

 “ sid , was it you that told ? ” 

 “ oh , never mind who it was . _ somebody _ told -- that 's enough . ” 

 “ sid , there 's only one person in this town mean enough to do that , and 
 that 's you . if you had been in huck 's place you 'd ' a ' sneaked down the 
 hill and never told anybody on the robbers . you ca n't do any but mean 
 things , and you ca n't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones . 
 there -- no thanks , as the widow says”--and tom cuffed sid 's ears and helped 
 him to the door with several kicks . “ now go and tell auntie if you 
 dare -- and tomorrow you 'll catch it ! ” 

 some minutes later the widow 's guests were at the supper - table , and a 
 dozen children were propped up at little side - tables in the same room , 
 after the fashion of that country and that day . at the proper time mr. 
 jones made his little speech , in which he thanked the widow for the 
 honor she was doing himself and his sons , but said that there was 
 another person whose modesty-- 

 and so forth and so on . he sprung his secret about huck 's share in 
 the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of , but the 
 surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and 
 effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances . however , 
 the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment , and heaped so many 
 compliments and so much gratitude upon huck that he almost forgot 
 the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely 
 intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody 's gaze 
 and everybody 's laudations . 

 the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have him 
 educated ; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in 
 business in a modest way . tom 's chance was come . he said : 

 “ huck do n't need it . huck 's rich . ” 

 nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept 
 back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke . but 
 the silence was a little awkward . tom broke it : 

 “ huck 's got money . maybe you do n't believe it , but he 's got lots of it . 
 oh , you need n't smile -- i reckon i can show you . you just wait a minute . ” 

 tom ran out of doors . the company looked at each other with a perplexed 
 interest -- and inquiringly at huck , who was tongue - tied . 

 “ sid , what ails tom ? ” said aunt polly . “ he -- well , there ai n't ever any 
 making of that boy out . i never-- ” 

 tom entered , struggling with the weight of his sacks , and aunt polly 
 did not finish her sentence . tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the 
 table and said : 

 “ there -- what did i tell you ? half of it 's huck 's and half of it 's mine ! ” 

 the spectacle took the general breath away . all gazed , nobody spoke for 
 a moment . then there was a unanimous call for an explanation . tom said 
 he could furnish it , and he did . the tale was long , but brimful of 
 interest . there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the 
 charm of its flow . when he had finished , mr. jones said : 

 “ i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion , but it 
 do n't amount to anything now . this one makes it sing mighty small , i 'm 
 willing to allow . ” 

 the money was counted . the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand 
 dollars . it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time 
 before , though several persons were there who were worth considerably 
 more than that in property . 




 chapter xxxv 

 the reader may rest satisfied that tom 's and huck 's windfall made a 
 mighty stir in the poor little village of st. petersburg . so vast a 
 sum , all in actual cash , seemed next to incredible . it was talked 
 about , gloated over , glorified , until the reason of many of the citizens 
 tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement . every “ haunted ” 
  house in st. petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected , 
 plank by plank , and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden 
 treasure -- and not by boys , but men -- pretty grave , unromantic men , too , 
 some of them . wherever tom and huck appeared they were courted , admired , 
 stared at . the boys were not able to remember that their remarks had 
 possessed weight before ; but now their sayings were treasured and 
 repeated ; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as 
 remarkable ; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying 
 commonplace things ; moreover , their past history was raked up and 
 discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality . the village paper 
 published biographical sketches of the boys . 

 the widow douglas put huck 's money out at six per cent . , and judge 
 thatcher did the same with tom 's at aunt polly 's request . each lad had 
 an income , now , that was simply prodigious -- a dollar for every weekday in 
 the year and half of the sundays . it was just what the minister got -- no , 
 it was what he was promised -- he generally could n't collect it . a dollar 
 and a quarter a week would board , lodge , and school a boy in those old 
 simple days -- and clothe him and wash him , too , for that matter . 

 judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom . he said that no 
 commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave . when 
 becky told her father , in strict confidence , how tom had taken her 
 whipping at school , the judge was visibly moved ; and when she pleaded 
 grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that 
 whipping from her shoulders to his own , the judge said with a fine 
 outburst that it was a noble , a generous , a magnanimous lie -- a lie that 
 was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to 
 breast with george washington 's lauded truth about the hatchet ! becky 
 thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he 
 walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that . she went straight 
 off and told tom about it . 

 judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some 
 day . he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the 
 national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school 
 in the country , in order that he might be ready for either career or 
 both . 

 huck finn 's wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas ' 
 protection introduced him into society -- no , dragged him into it , hurled 
 him into it -- and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear . the 
 widow 's servants kept him clean and neat , combed and brushed , and they 
 bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot 
 or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend . he had 
 to eat with a knife and fork ; he had to use napkin , cup , and plate ; 
 he had to learn his book , he had to go to church ; he had to talk so 
 properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth ; whithersoever he 
 turned , the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him 
 hand and foot . 

 he bravely bore his miseries three weeks , and then one day turned up 
 missing . for forty - eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in 
 great distress . the public were profoundly concerned ; they searched high 
 and low , they dragged the river for his body . early the third morning 
 tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind 
 the abandoned slaughter - house , and in one of them he found the refugee . 
 huck had slept there ; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and 
 ends of food , and was lying off , now , in comfort , with his pipe . he was 
 unkempt , uncombed , and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made 
 him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy . tom routed him 
 out , told him the trouble he had been causing , and urged him to go home . 
 huck 's face lost its tranquil content , and took a melancholy cast . he 
 said : 

 “ do n't talk about it , tom . i 've tried it , and it do n't work ; it do n't 
 work , tom . it ai n't for me ; i ai n't used to it . the widder 's good to me , 
 and friendly ; but i ca n't stand them ways . she makes me get up just 
 at the same time every morning ; she makes me wash , they comb me all 
 to thunder ; she wo n't let me sleep in the woodshed ; i got to wear them 
 blamed clothes that just smothers me , tom ; they do n't seem to any air 
 git through 'em , somehow ; and they 're so rotten nice that i ca n't 
 set down , nor lay down , nor roll around anywher 's ; i hain't slid on a 
 cellar - door for -- well , it ' pears to be years ; i got to go to church 
 and sweat and sweat -- i hate them ornery sermons ! i ca n't ketch a fly in 
 there , i ca n't chaw . i got to wear shoes all sunday . the widder eats by 
 a bell ; she goes to bed by a bell ; she gits up by a bell -- everything 's so 
 awful reg'lar a body ca n't stand it . ” 

 “ well , everybody does that way , huck . ” 

 “ tom , it do n't make no difference . i ai n't everybody , and i ca n't 
 _ stand _ it . it 's awful to be tied up so . and grub comes too easy -- i do n't 
 take no interest in vittles , that way . i got to ask to go a - fishing ; 
 i got to ask to go in a - swimming -- dern'd if i hain't got to ask to do 
 everything . well , i 'd got to talk so nice it was n't no comfort -- i'd got 
 to go up in the attic and rip out awhile , every day , to git a taste 
 in my mouth , or i 'd a died , tom . the widder would n't let me smoke ; 
 she would n't let me yell , she would n't let me gape , nor stretch , nor 
 scratch , before folks-- ” [ then with a spasm of special irritation and 
 injury]--“and dad fetch it , she prayed all the time ! i never see such a 
 woman ! i _ had _ to shove , tom -- i just had to . and besides , that school 's 
 going to open , and i 'd a had to go to it -- well , i would n't stand _ that _ , 
 tom . looky - here , tom , being rich ai n't what it 's cracked up to be . it 's 
 just worry and worry , and sweat and sweat , and a - wishing you was dead 
 all the time . now these clothes suits me , and this bar'l suits me , and 
 i ai n't ever going to shake 'em any more . tom , i would n't ever got into 
 all this trouble if it had n't ' a ' ben for that money ; now you just take 
 my sheer of it along with your'n , and gimme a ten - center sometimes -- not 
 many times , becuz i do n't give a dern for a thing ' thout it 's tollable 
 hard to git -- and you go and beg off for me with the widder . ” 

 “ oh , huck , you know i ca n't do that . ' tain't fair ; and besides if you 'll 
 try this thing just a while longer you 'll come to like it . ” 

 “ like it ! yes -- the way i 'd like a hot stove if i was to set on it long 
 enough . no , tom , i wo n't be rich , and i wo n't live in them cussed 
 smothery houses . i like the woods , and the river , and hogsheads , and 
 i 'll stick to 'em , too . blame it all ! just as we 'd got guns , and a cave , 
 and all just fixed to rob , here this dern foolishness has got to come up 
 and spile it all ! ” 

 tom saw his opportunity-- 

 “ lookyhere , huck , being rich ai n't going to keep me back from turning 
 robber . ” 

 “ no ! oh , good - licks ; are you in real dead - wood earnest , tom ? ” 

 “ just as dead earnest as i 'm sitting here . but huck , we ca n't let you 
 into the gang if you ai n't respectable , you know . ” 

 huck 's joy was quenched . 

 “ ca n't let me in , tom ? did n't you let me go for a pirate ? ” 

 “ yes , but that 's different . a robber is more high - toned than what a 
 pirate is -- as a general thing . in most countries they 're awful high up in 
 the nobility -- dukes and such . ” 

 “ now , tom , hain't you always ben friendly to me ? you would n't shet me 
 out , would you , tom ? you would n't do that , now , _ would _ you , tom ? ” 

 “ huck , i would n't want to , and i _ do n't _ want to -- but what would people 
 say ? why , they 'd say , ' mph ! tom sawyer 's gang ! pretty low characters in 
 it ! ' they 'd mean you , huck . you would n't like that , and i would n't . ” 

 huck was silent for some time , engaged in a mental struggle . finally he 
 said : 

 “ well , i 'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if i 
 can come to stand it , if you 'll let me b'long to the gang , tom . ” 

 “ all right , huck , it 's a whiz ! come along , old chap , and i 'll ask the 
 widow to let up on you a little , huck . ” 

 “ will you , tom -- now will you ? that 's good . if she 'll let up on some of 
 the roughest things , i 'll smoke private and cuss private , and crowd 
 through or bust . when you going to start the gang and turn robbers ? ” 

 “ oh , right off . we 'll get the boys together and have the initiation 
 tonight , maybe . ” 

 “ have the which ? ” 

 “ have the initiation . ” 

 “ what 's that ? ” 

 “ it 's to swear to stand by one another , and never tell the gang 's 
 secrets , even if you 're chopped all to flinders , and kill anybody and 
 all his family that hurts one of the gang . ” 

 “ that 's gay -- that 's mighty gay , tom , i tell you . ” 

 “ well , i bet it is . and all that swearing 's got to be done at midnight , 
 in the lonesomest , awfulest place you can find -- a ha'nted house is the 
 best , but they 're all ripped up now . ” 

 “ well , midnight 's good , anyway , tom . ” 

 “ yes , so it is . and you 've got to swear on a coffin , and sign it with 
 blood . ” 

 “ now , that 's something _ like _ ! why , it 's a million times bullier than 
 pirating . i 'll stick to the widder till i rot , tom ; and if i git to be 
 a reg'lar ripper of a robber , and everybody talking 'bout it , i reckon 
 she 'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet . ” 

 conclusion 

 so endeth this chronicle . it being strictly a history of a _ boy _ , it 
 must stop here ; the story could not go much further without becoming the 
 history of a _ man_. when one writes a novel about grown people , he knows 
 exactly where to stop -- that is , with a marriage ; but when he writes of 
 juveniles , he must stop where he best can . 

 most of the characters that perform in this book still live , and are 
 prosperous and happy . some day it may seem worth while to take up the 
 story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they 
 turned out to be ; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that 
 part of their lives at present .

 adventure i. a scandal in bohemia 

 i. 

 to sherlock holmes she is always the woman . i have seldom heard 
 him mention her under any other name . in his eyes she eclipses 
 and predominates the whole of her sex . it was not that he felt 
 any emotion akin to love for irene adler . all emotions , and that 
 one particularly , were abhorrent to his cold , precise but 
 admirably balanced mind . he was , i take it , the most perfect 
 reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen , but as a 
 lover he would have placed himself in a false position . he never 
 spoke of the softer passions , save with a gibe and a sneer . they 
 were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the 
 veil from men 's motives and actions . but for the trained reasoner 
 to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely 
 adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which 
 might throw a doubt upon all his mental results . grit in a 
 sensitive instrument , or a crack in one of his own high - power 
 lenses , would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a 
 nature such as his . and yet there was but one woman to him , and 
 that woman was the late irene adler , of dubious and questionable 
 memory . 

 i had seen little of holmes lately . my marriage had drifted us 
 away from each other . my own complete happiness , and the 
 home - centred interests which rise up around the man who first 
 finds himself master of his own establishment , were sufficient to 
 absorb all my attention , while holmes , who loathed every form of 
 society with his whole bohemian soul , remained in our lodgings in 
 baker street , buried among his old books , and alternating from 
 week to week between cocaine and ambition , the drowsiness of the 
 drug , and the fierce energy of his own keen nature . he was still , 
 as ever , deeply attracted by the study of crime , and occupied his 
 immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in 
 following out those clues , and clearing up those mysteries which 
 had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police . from time 
 to time i heard some vague account of his doings : of his summons 
 to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder , of his clearing up 
 of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee , 
 and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so 
 delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland . 
 beyond these signs of his activity , however , which i merely 
 shared with all the readers of the daily press , i knew little of 
 my former friend and companion . 

 one night -- it was on the twentieth of march , 1888 - -i was 
 returning from a journey to a patient ( for i had now returned to 
 civil practice ) , when my way led me through baker street . as i 
 passed the well - remembered door , which must always be associated 
 in my mind with my wooing , and with the dark incidents of the 
 study in scarlet , i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes 
 again , and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers . 
 his rooms were brilliantly lit , and , even as i looked up , i saw 
 his tall , spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against 
 the blind . he was pacing the room swiftly , eagerly , with his head 
 sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him . to me , who 
 knew his every mood and habit , his attitude and manner told their 
 own story . he was at work again . he had risen out of his 
 drug - created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new 
 problem . i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which 
 had formerly been in part my own . 

 his manner was not effusive . it seldom was ; but he was glad , i 
 think , to see me . with hardly a word spoken , but with a kindly 
 eye , he waved me to an armchair , threw across his case of cigars , 
 and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner . then he 
 stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular 
 introspective fashion . 

 " wedlock suits you , " he remarked . " i think , watson , that you have 
 put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you . " 

 " seven ! " i answered . 

 " indeed , i should have thought a little more . just a trifle more , 
 i fancy , watson . and in practice again , i observe . you did not 
 tell me that you intended to go into harness . " 

 " then , how do you know ? " 

 " i see it , i deduce it . how do i know that you have been getting 
 yourself very wet lately , and that you have a most clumsy and 
 careless servant girl ? " 

 " my dear holmes , " said i , " this is too much . you would certainly 
 have been burned , had you lived a few centuries ago . it is true 
 that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful 
 mess , but as i have changed my clothes i ca n't imagine how you 
 deduce it . as to mary jane , she is incorrigible , and my wife has 
 given her notice , but there , again , i fail to see how you work it 
 out . " 

 he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long , nervous hands 
 together . 

 " it is simplicity itself , " said he ; " my eyes tell me that on the 
 inside of your left shoe , just where the firelight strikes it , 
 the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts . obviously they 
 have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round 
 the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it . 
 hence , you see , my double deduction that you had been out in vile 
 weather , and that you had a particularly malignant boot - slitting 
 specimen of the london slavey . as to your practice , if a 
 gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform , with a black 
 mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger , and a bulge 
 on the right side of his top - hat to show where he has secreted 
 his stethoscope , i must be dull , indeed , if i do not pronounce 
 him to be an active member of the medical profession . " 

 i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his 
 process of deduction . " when i hear you give your reasons , " i 
 remarked , " the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously 
 simple that i could easily do it myself , though at each 
 successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you 
 explain your process . and yet i believe that my eyes are as good 
 as yours . " 

 " quite so , " he answered , lighting a cigarette , and throwing 
 himself down into an armchair . " you see , but you do not observe . 
 the distinction is clear . for example , you have frequently seen 
 the steps which lead up from the hall to this room . " 

 " frequently . " 

 " how often ? " 

 " well , some hundreds of times . " 

 " then how many are there ? " 

 " how many ? i do n't know . " 

 " quite so ! you have not observed . and yet you have seen . that is 
 just my point . now , i know that there are seventeen steps , 
 because i have both seen and observed . by - the - way , since you are 
 interested in these little problems , and since you are good 
 enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences , you 
 may be interested in this . " he threw over a sheet of thick , 
 pink - tinted note - paper which had been lying open upon the table . 
 " it came by the last post , " said he . " read it aloud . " 

 the note was undated , and without either signature or address . 

 " there will call upon you to - night , at a quarter to eight 
 o'clock , " it said , " a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a 
 matter of the very deepest moment . your recent services to one of 
 the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may 
 safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which 
 can hardly be exaggerated . this account of you we have from all 
 quarters received . be in your chamber then at that hour , and do 
 not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask . " 

 " this is indeed a mystery , " i remarked . " what do you imagine that 
 it means ? " 

 " i have no data yet . it is a capital mistake to theorize before 
 one has data . insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit 
 theories , instead of theories to suit facts . but the note itself . 
 what do you deduce from it ? " 

 i carefully examined the writing , and the paper upon which it was 
 written . 

 " the man who wrote it was presumably well to do , " i remarked , 
 endeavouring to imitate my companion 's processes . " such paper 
 could not be bought under half a crown a packet . it is peculiarly 
 strong and stiff . " 

 " peculiar -- that is the very word , " said holmes . " it is not an 
 english paper at all . hold it up to the light . " 

 i did so , and saw a large " e " with a small " g , " a " p , " and a 
 large " g " with a small " t " woven into the texture of the paper . 

 " what do you make of that ? " asked holmes . 

 " the name of the maker , no doubt ; or his monogram , rather . " 

 " not at all . the ' g ' with the small ' t ' stands for 
 ' gesellschaft , ' which is the german for ' company . ' it is a 
 customary contraction like our ' co. ' ' p , ' of course , stands for 
 ' papier . ' now for the ' eg . ' let us glance at our continental 
 gazetteer . " he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves . 
 " eglow , eglonitz -- here we are , egria . it is in a german - speaking 
 country -- in bohemia , not far from carlsbad . ' remarkable as being 
 the scene of the death of wallenstein , and for its numerous 
 glass - factories and paper - mills . ' ha , ha , my boy , what do you 
 make of that ? " his eyes sparkled , and he sent up a great blue 
 triumphant cloud from his cigarette . 

 " the paper was made in bohemia , " i said . 

 " precisely . and the man who wrote the note is a german . do you 
 note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'this account of 
 you we have from all quarters received . ' a frenchman or russian 
 could not have written that . it is the german who is so 
 uncourteous to his verbs . it only remains , therefore , to discover 
 what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and 
 prefers wearing a mask to showing his face . and here he comes , if 
 i am not mistaken , to resolve all our doubts . " 

 as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses ' hoofs and 
 grating wheels against the curb , followed by a sharp pull at the 
 bell . holmes whistled . 

 " a pair , by the sound , " said he . " yes , " he continued , glancing 
 out of the window . " a nice little brougham and a pair of 
 beauties . a hundred and fifty guineas apiece . there 's money in 
 this case , watson , if there is nothing else . " 

 " i think that i had better go , holmes . " 

 " not a bit , doctor . stay where you are . i am lost without my 
 boswell . and this promises to be interesting . it would be a pity 
 to miss it . " 

 " but your client-- " 

 " never mind him . i may want your help , and so may he . here he 
 comes . sit down in that armchair , doctor , and give us your best 
 attention . " 

 a slow and heavy step , which had been heard upon the stairs and 
 in the passage , paused immediately outside the door . then there 
 was a loud and authoritative tap . 

 " come in ! " said holmes . 

 a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six 
 inches in height , with the chest and limbs of a hercules . his 
 dress was rich with a richness which would , in england , be looked 
 upon as akin to bad taste . heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed 
 across the sleeves and fronts of his double - breasted coat , while 
 the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined 
 with flame - coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch 
 which consisted of a single flaming beryl . boots which extended 
 halfway up his calves , and which were trimmed at the tops with 
 rich brown fur , completed the impression of barbaric opulence 
 which was suggested by his whole appearance . he carried a 
 broad - brimmed hat in his hand , while he wore across the upper 
 part of his face , extending down past the cheekbones , a black 
 vizard mask , which he had apparently adjusted that very moment , 
 for his hand was still raised to it as he entered . from the lower 
 part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character , 
 with a thick , hanging lip , and a long , straight chin suggestive 
 of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy . 

 " you had my note ? " he asked with a deep harsh voice and a 
 strongly marked german accent . " i told you that i would call . " he 
 looked from one to the other of us , as if uncertain which to 
 address . 

 " pray take a seat , " said holmes . " this is my friend and 
 colleague , dr. watson , who is occasionally good enough to help me 
 in my cases . whom have i the honour to address ? " 

 " you may address me as the count von kramm , a bohemian nobleman . 
 i understand that this gentleman , your friend , is a man of honour 
 and discretion , whom i may trust with a matter of the most 
 extreme importance . if not , i should much prefer to communicate 
 with you alone . " 

 i rose to go , but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me 
 back into my chair . " it is both , or none , " said he . " you may say 
 before this gentleman anything which you may say to me . " 

 the count shrugged his broad shoulders . " then i must begin , " said 
 he , " by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years ; at 
 the end of that time the matter will be of no importance . at 
 present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it 
 may have an influence upon european history . " 

 " i promise , " said holmes . 

 " and i. " 

 " you will excuse this mask , " continued our strange visitor . " the 
 august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to 
 you , and i may confess at once that the title by which i have 
 just called myself is not exactly my own . " 

 " i was aware of it , " said holmes dryly . 

 " the circumstances are of great delicacy , and every precaution 
 has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense 
 scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of 
 europe . to speak plainly , the matter implicates the great house 
 of ormstein , hereditary kings of bohemia . " 

 " i was also aware of that , " murmured holmes , settling himself 
 down in his armchair and closing his eyes . 

 our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid , 
 lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him 
 as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe . 
 holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his 
 gigantic client . 

 " if your majesty would condescend to state your case , " he 
 remarked , " i should be better able to advise you . " 

 the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in 
 uncontrollable agitation . then , with a gesture of desperation , he 
 tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground . " you 
 are right , " he cried ; " i am the king . why should i attempt to 
 conceal it ? " 

 " why , indeed ? " murmured holmes . " your majesty had not spoken 
 before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich 
 sigismond von ormstein , grand duke of cassel - felstein , and 
 hereditary king of bohemia . " 

 " but you can understand , " said our strange visitor , sitting down 
 once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead , " you 
 can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in 
 my own person . yet the matter was so delicate that i could not 
 confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power . i 
 have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting 
 you . " 

 " then , pray consult , " said holmes , shutting his eyes once more . 

 " the facts are briefly these : some five years ago , during a 
 lengthy visit to warsaw , i made the acquaintance of the well - known 
 adventuress , irene adler . the name is no doubt familiar to you . " 

 " kindly look her up in my index , doctor , " murmured holmes without 
 opening his eyes . for many years he had adopted a system of 
 docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things , so that it 
 was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not 
 at once furnish information . in this case i found her biography 
 sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a 
 staff - commander who had written a monograph upon the deep - sea 
 fishes . 

 " let me see ! " said holmes . " hum ! born in new jersey in the year 
 1858 . contralto -- hum ! la scala , hum ! prima donna imperial opera 
 of warsaw -- yes ! retired from operatic stage -- ha ! living in 
 london -- quite so ! your majesty , as i understand , became entangled 
 with this young person , wrote her some compromising letters , and 
 is now desirous of getting those letters back . " 

 " precisely so . but how-- " 

 " was there a secret marriage ? " 

 " none . " 

 " no legal papers or certificates ? " 

 " none . " 

 " then i fail to follow your majesty . if this young person should 
 produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes , how is 
 she to prove their authenticity ? " 

 " there is the writing . " 

 " pooh , pooh ! forgery . " 

 " my private note - paper . " 

 " stolen . " 

 " my own seal . " 

 " imitated . " 

 " my photograph . " 

 " bought . " 

 " we were both in the photograph . " 

 " oh , dear ! that is very bad ! your majesty has indeed committed an 
 indiscretion . " 

 " i was mad -- insane . " 

 " you have compromised yourself seriously . " 

 " i was only crown prince then . i was young . i am but thirty now . " 

 " it must be recovered . " 

 " we have tried and failed . " 

 " your majesty must pay . it must be bought . " 

 " she will not sell . " 

 " stolen , then . " 

 " five attempts have been made . twice burglars in my pay ransacked 
 her house . once we diverted her luggage when she travelled . twice 
 she has been waylaid . there has been no result . " 

 " no sign of it ? " 

 " absolutely none . " 

 holmes laughed . " it is quite a pretty little problem , " said he . 

 " but a very serious one to me , " returned the king reproachfully . 

 " very , indeed . and what does she propose to do with the 
 photograph ? " 

 " to ruin me . " 

 " but how ? " 

 " i am about to be married . " 

 " so i have heard . " 

 " to clotilde lothman von saxe - meningen , second daughter of the 
 king of scandinavia . you may know the strict principles of her 
 family . she is herself the very soul of delicacy . a shadow of a 
 doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end . " 

 " and irene adler ? " 

 " threatens to send them the photograph . and she will do it . i 
 know that she will do it . you do not know her , but she has a soul 
 of steel . she has the face of the most beautiful of women , and 
 the mind of the most resolute of men . rather than i should marry 
 another woman , there are no lengths to which she would not 
 go -- none . " 

 " you are sure that she has not sent it yet ? " 

 " i am sure . " 

 " and why ? " 

 " because she has said that she would send it on the day when the 
 betrothal was publicly proclaimed . that will be next monday . " 

 " oh , then we have three days yet , " said holmes with a yawn . " that 
 is very fortunate , as i have one or two matters of importance to 
 look into just at present . your majesty will , of course , stay in 
 london for the present ? " 

 " certainly . you will find me at the langham under the name of the 
 count von kramm . " 

 " then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress . " 

 " pray do so . i shall be all anxiety . " 

 " then , as to money ? " 

 " you have carte blanche . " 

 " absolutely ? " 

 " i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom 
 to have that photograph . " 

 " and for present expenses ? " 

 the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak 
 and laid it on the table . 

 " there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in 
 notes , " he said . 

 holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note - book and 
 handed it to him . 

 " and mademoiselle 's address ? " he asked . 

 " is briony lodge , serpentine avenue , st. john 's wood . " 

 holmes took a note of it . " one other question , " said he . " was the 
 photograph a cabinet ? " 

 " it was . " 

 " then , good - night , your majesty , and i trust that we shall soon 
 have some good news for you . and good - night , watson , " he added , 
 as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street . " if 
 you will be good enough to call to - morrow afternoon at three 
 o'clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you . " 


 ii . 

 at three o'clock precisely i was at baker street , but holmes had 
 not yet returned . the landlady informed me that he had left the 
 house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning . i sat down 
 beside the fire , however , with the intention of awaiting him , 
 however long he might be . i was already deeply interested in his 
 inquiry , for , though it was surrounded by none of the grim and 
 strange features which were associated with the two crimes which 
 i have already recorded , still , the nature of the case and the 
 exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own . 
 indeed , apart from the nature of the investigation which my 
 friend had on hand , there was something in his masterly grasp of 
 a situation , and his keen , incisive reasoning , which made it a 
 pleasure to me to study his system of work , and to follow the 
 quick , subtle methods by which he disentangled the most 
 inextricable mysteries . so accustomed was i to his invariable 
 success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to 
 enter into my head . 

 it was close upon four before the door opened , and a 
 drunken - looking groom , ill - kempt and side - whiskered , with an 
 inflamed face and disreputable clothes , walked into the room . 
 accustomed as i was to my friend 's amazing powers in the use of 
 disguises , i had to look three times before i was certain that it 
 was indeed he . with a nod he vanished into the bedroom , whence he 
 emerged in five minutes tweed - suited and respectable , as of old . 
 putting his hands into his pockets , he stretched out his legs in 
 front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes . 

 " well , really ! " he cried , and then he choked and laughed again 
 until he was obliged to lie back , limp and helpless , in the 
 chair . 

 " what is it ? " 

 " it 's quite too funny . i am sure you could never guess how i 
 employed my morning , or what i ended by doing . " 

 " i ca n't imagine . i suppose that you have been watching the 
 habits , and perhaps the house , of miss irene adler . " 

 " quite so ; but the sequel was rather unusual . i will tell you , 
 however . i left the house a little after eight o'clock this 
 morning in the character of a groom out of work . there is a 
 wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men . be one of 
 them , and you will know all that there is to know . i soon found 
 briony lodge . it is a bijou villa , with a garden at the back , but 
 built out in front right up to the road , two stories . chubb lock 
 to the door . large sitting - room on the right side , well 
 furnished , with long windows almost to the floor , and those 
 preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open . 
 behind there was nothing remarkable , save that the passage window 
 could be reached from the top of the coach - house . i walked round 
 it and examined it closely from every point of view , but without 
 noting anything else of interest . 

 " i then lounged down the street and found , as i expected , that 
 there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the 
 garden . i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses , 
 and received in exchange twopence , a glass of half and half , two 
 fills of shag tobacco , and as much information as i could desire 
 about miss adler , to say nothing of half a dozen other people in 
 the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested , but 
 whose biographies i was compelled to listen to . " 

 " and what of irene adler ? " i asked . 

 " oh , she has turned all the men 's heads down in that part . she is 
 the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet . so say the 
 serpentine - mews , to a man . she lives quietly , sings at concerts , 
 drives out at five every day , and returns at seven sharp for 
 dinner . seldom goes out at other times , except when she sings . 
 has only one male visitor , but a good deal of him . he is dark , 
 handsome , and dashing , never calls less than once a day , and 
 often twice . he is a mr. godfrey norton , of the inner temple . see 
 the advantages of a cabman as a confidant . they had driven him 
 home a dozen times from serpentine - mews , and knew all about him . 
 when i had listened to all they had to tell , i began to walk up 
 and down near briony lodge once more , and to think over my plan 
 of campaign . 

 " this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the 
 matter . he was a lawyer . that sounded ominous . what was the 
 relation between them , and what the object of his repeated 
 visits ? was she his client , his friend , or his mistress ? if the 
 former , she had probably transferred the photograph to his 
 keeping . if the latter , it was less likely . on the issue of this 
 question depended whether i should continue my work at briony 
 lodge , or turn my attention to the gentleman 's chambers in the 
 temple . it was a delicate point , and it widened the field of my 
 inquiry . i fear that i bore you with these details , but i have to 
 let you see my little difficulties , if you are to understand the 
 situation . " 

 " i am following you closely , " i answered . 

 " i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab 
 drove up to briony lodge , and a gentleman sprang out . he was a 
 remarkably handsome man , dark , aquiline , and moustached -- evidently 
 the man of whom i had heard . he appeared to be in a 
 great hurry , shouted to the cabman to wait , and brushed past the 
 maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly 
 at home . 

 " he was in the house about half an hour , and i could catch 
 glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting - room , pacing up and 
 down , talking excitedly , and waving his arms . of her i could see 
 nothing . presently he emerged , looking even more flurried than 
 before . as he stepped up to the cab , he pulled a gold watch from 
 his pocket and looked at it earnestly , ' drive like the devil , ' he 
 shouted , ' first to gross & hankey 's in regent street , and then to 
 the church of st. monica in the edgeware road . half a guinea if 
 you do it in twenty minutes ! ' 

 " away they went , and i was just wondering whether i should not do 
 well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau , 
 the coachman with his coat only half - buttoned , and his tie under 
 his ear , while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of 
 the buckles . it had n't pulled up before she shot out of the hall 
 door and into it . i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment , 
 but she was a lovely woman , with a face that a man might die for . 

 " ' the church of st. monica , john , ' she cried , ' and half a 
 sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes . ' 

 " this was quite too good to lose , watson . i was just balancing 
 whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her 
 landau when a cab came through the street . the driver looked 
 twice at such a shabby fare , but i jumped in before he could 
 object . ' the church of st. monica , ' said i , ' and half a sovereign 
 if you reach it in twenty minutes . ' it was twenty - five minutes to 
 twelve , and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind . 

 " my cabby drove fast . i do n't think i ever drove faster , but the 
 others were there before us . the cab and the landau with their 
 steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived . i paid 
 the man and hurried into the church . there was not a soul there 
 save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman , who 
 seemed to be expostulating with them . they were all three 
 standing in a knot in front of the altar . i lounged up the side 
 aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church . 
 suddenly , to my surprise , the three at the altar faced round to 
 me , and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards 
 me . 

 " ' thank god , ' he cried . ' you 'll do . come ! come ! ' 

 " ' what then ? ' i asked . 

 " ' come , man , come , only three minutes , or it wo n't be legal . ' 

 " i was half - dragged up to the altar , and before i knew where i was 
 i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear , 
 and vouching for things of which i knew nothing , and generally 
 assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler , spinster , to 
 godfrey norton , bachelor . it was all done in an instant , and 
 there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady 
 on the other , while the clergyman beamed on me in front . it was 
 the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my 
 life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just 
 now . it seems that there had been some informality about their 
 license , that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them 
 without a witness of some sort , and that my lucky appearance 
 saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in 
 search of a best man . the bride gave me a sovereign , and i mean 
 to wear it on my watch - chain in memory of the occasion . " 

 " this is a very unexpected turn of affairs , " said i ; " and what 
 then ? " 

 " well , i found my plans very seriously menaced . it looked as if 
 the pair might take an immediate departure , and so necessitate 
 very prompt and energetic measures on my part . at the church 
 door , however , they separated , he driving back to the temple , and 
 she to her own house . ' i shall drive out in the park at five as 
 usual , ' she said as she left him . i heard no more . they drove 
 away in different directions , and i went off to make my own 
 arrangements . " 

 " which are ? " 

 " some cold beef and a glass of beer , " he answered , ringing the 
 bell . " i have been too busy to think of food , and i am likely to 
 be busier still this evening . by the way , doctor , i shall want 
 your co - operation . " 

 " i shall be delighted . " 

 " you do n't mind breaking the law ? " 

 " not in the least . " 

 " nor running a chance of arrest ? " 

 " not in a good cause . " 

 " oh , the cause is excellent ! " 

 " then i am your man . " 

 " i was sure that i might rely on you . " 

 " but what is it you wish ? " 

 " when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to 
 you . now , " he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that 
 our landlady had provided , " i must discuss it while i eat , for i 
 have not much time . it is nearly five now . in two hours we must 
 be on the scene of action . miss irene , or madame , rather , returns 
 from her drive at seven . we must be at briony lodge to meet her . " 

 " and what then ? " 

 " you must leave that to me . i have already arranged what is to 
 occur . there is only one point on which i must insist . you must 
 not interfere , come what may . you understand ? " 

 " i am to be neutral ? " 

 " to do nothing whatever . there will probably be some small 
 unpleasantness . do not join in it . it will end in my being 
 conveyed into the house . four or five minutes afterwards the 
 sitting - room window will open . you are to station yourself close 
 to that open window . " 

 " yes . " 

 " you are to watch me , for i will be visible to you . " 

 " yes . " 

 " and when i raise my hand -- so -- you will throw into the room what 
 i give you to throw , and will , at the same time , raise the cry of 
 fire . you quite follow me ? " 

 " entirely . " 

 " it is nothing very formidable , " he said , taking a long cigar - shaped 
 roll from his pocket . " it is an ordinary plumber 's smoke - rocket , 
 fitted with a cap at either end to make it self - lighting . 
 your task is confined to that . when you raise your cry of fire , 
 it will be taken up by quite a number of people . you may then 
 walk to the end of the street , and i will rejoin you in ten 
 minutes . i hope that i have made myself clear ? " 

 " i am to remain neutral , to get near the window , to watch you , 
 and at the signal to throw in this object , then to raise the cry 
 of fire , and to wait you at the corner of the street . " 

 " precisely . " 

 " then you may entirely rely on me . " 

 " that is excellent . i think , perhaps , it is almost time that i 
 prepare for the new role i have to play . " 

 he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in 
 the character of an amiable and simple - minded nonconformist 
 clergyman . his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white 
 tie , his sympathetic smile , and general look of peering and 
 benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have 
 equalled . it was not merely that holmes changed his costume . his 
 expression , his manner , his very soul seemed to vary with every 
 fresh part that he assumed . the stage lost a fine actor , even as 
 science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in 
 crime . 

 it was a quarter past six when we left baker street , and it still 
 wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in 
 serpentine avenue . it was already dusk , and the lamps were just 
 being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge , 
 waiting for the coming of its occupant . the house was just such 
 as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes ' succinct description , 
 but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected . on 
 the contrary , for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood , it was 
 remarkably animated . there was a group of shabbily dressed men 
 smoking and laughing in a corner , a scissors - grinder with his 
 wheel , two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse - girl , and 
 several well - dressed young men who were lounging up and down with 
 cigars in their mouths . 

 " you see , " remarked holmes , as we paced to and fro in front of 
 the house , " this marriage rather simplifies matters . the 
 photograph becomes a double - edged weapon now . the chances are 
 that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey 
 norton , as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his 
 princess . now the question is , where are we to find the 
 photograph ? " 

 " where , indeed ? " 

 " it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her . it is 
 cabinet size . too large for easy concealment about a woman 's 
 dress . she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid 
 and searched . two attempts of the sort have already been made . we 
 may take it , then , that she does not carry it about with her . " 

 " where , then ? " 

 " her banker or her lawyer . there is that double possibility . but 
 i am inclined to think neither . women are naturally secretive , 
 and they like to do their own secreting . why should she hand it 
 over to anyone else ? she could trust her own guardianship , but 
 she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be 
 brought to bear upon a business man . besides , remember that she 
 had resolved to use it within a few days . it must be where she 
 can lay her hands upon it . it must be in her own house . " 

 " but it has twice been burgled . " 

 " pshaw ! they did not know how to look . " 

 " but how will you look ? " 

 " i will not look . " 

 " what then ? " 

 " i will get her to show me . " 

 " but she will refuse . " 

 " she will not be able to . but i hear the rumble of wheels . it is 
 her carriage . now carry out my orders to the letter . " 

 as he spoke the gleam of the side - lights of a carriage came round 
 the curve of the avenue . it was a smart little landau which 
 rattled up to the door of briony lodge . as it pulled up , one of 
 the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in 
 the hope of earning a copper , but was elbowed away by another 
 loafer , who had rushed up with the same intention . a fierce 
 quarrel broke out , which was increased by the two guardsmen , who 
 took sides with one of the loungers , and by the scissors - grinder , 
 who was equally hot upon the other side . a blow was struck , and 
 in an instant the lady , who had stepped from her carriage , was 
 the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men , who 
 struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks . holmes 
 dashed into the crowd to protect the lady ; but just as he reached 
 her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood 
 running freely down his face . at his fall the guardsmen took to 
 their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other , while 
 a number of better - dressed people , who had watched the scuffle 
 without taking part in it , crowded in to help the lady and to 
 attend to the injured man . irene adler , as i will still call her , 
 had hurried up the steps ; but she stood at the top with her 
 superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall , looking 
 back into the street . 

 " is the poor gentleman much hurt ? " she asked . 

 " he is dead , " cried several voices . 

 " no , no , there 's life in him ! " shouted another . " but he 'll be 
 gone before you can get him to hospital . " 

 " he 's a brave fellow , " said a woman . " they would have had the 
 lady 's purse and watch if it had n't been for him . they were a 
 gang , and a rough one , too . ah , he 's breathing now . " 

 " he ca n't lie in the street . may we bring him in , marm ? " 

 " surely . bring him into the sitting - room . there is a comfortable 
 sofa . this way , please ! " 

 slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out 
 in the principal room , while i still observed the proceedings 
 from my post by the window . the lamps had been lit , but the 
 blinds had not been drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay 
 upon the couch . i do not know whether he was seized with 
 compunction at that moment for the part he was playing , but i 
 know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life 
 than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was 
 conspiring , or the grace and kindliness with which she waited 
 upon the injured man . and yet it would be the blackest treachery 
 to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted 
 to me . i hardened my heart , and took the smoke - rocket from under 
 my ulster . after all , i thought , we are not injuring her . we are 
 but preventing her from injuring another . 

 holmes had sat up upon the couch , and i saw him motion like a man 
 who is in need of air . a maid rushed across and threw open the 
 window . at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the 
 signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of " fire ! " the 
 word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of 
 spectators , well dressed and ill -- gentlemen , ostlers , and 
 servant - maids -- joined in a general shriek of " fire ! " thick clouds 
 of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window . i 
 caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice 
 of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm . 
 slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner 
 of the street , and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my 
 friend 's arm in mine , and to get away from the scene of uproar . 
 he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we 
 had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the 
 edgeware road . 

 " you did it very nicely , doctor , " he remarked . " nothing could 
 have been better . it is all right . " 

 " you have the photograph ? " 

 " i know where it is . " 

 " and how did you find out ? " 

 " she showed me , as i told you she would . " 

 " i am still in the dark . " 

 " i do not wish to make a mystery , " said he , laughing . " the matter 
 was perfectly simple . you , of course , saw that everyone in the 
 street was an accomplice . they were all engaged for the evening . " 

 " i guessed as much . " 

 " then , when the row broke out , i had a little moist red paint in 
 the palm of my hand . i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand 
 to my face , and became a piteous spectacle . it is an old trick . " 

 " that also i could fathom . " 

 " then they carried me in . she was bound to have me in . what else 
 could she do ? and into her sitting - room , which was the very room 
 which i suspected . it lay between that and her bedroom , and i was 
 determined to see which . they laid me on a couch , i motioned for 
 air , they were compelled to open the window , and you had your 
 chance . " 

 " how did that help you ? " 

 " it was all - important . when a woman thinks that her house is on 
 fire , her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she 
 values most . it is a perfectly overpowering impulse , and i have 
 more than once taken advantage of it . in the case of the 
 darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me , and also in 
 the arnsworth castle business . a married woman grabs at her baby ; 
 an unmarried one reaches for her jewel - box . now it was clear to 
 me that our lady of to - day had nothing in the house more precious 
 to her than what we are in quest of . she would rush to secure it . 
 the alarm of fire was admirably done . the smoke and shouting were 
 enough to shake nerves of steel . she responded beautifully . the 
 photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the 
 right bell - pull . she was there in an instant , and i caught a 
 glimpse of it as she half - drew it out . when i cried out that it 
 was a false alarm , she replaced it , glanced at the rocket , rushed 
 from the room , and i have not seen her since . i rose , and , making 
 my excuses , escaped from the house . i hesitated whether to 
 attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had 
 come in , and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to 
 wait . a little over - precipitance may ruin all . " 

 " and now ? " i asked . 

 " our quest is practically finished . i shall call with the king 
 to - morrow , and with you , if you care to come with us . we will be 
 shown into the sitting - room to wait for the lady , but it is 
 probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the 
 photograph . it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain 
 it with his own hands . " 

 " and when will you call ? " 

 " at eight in the morning . she will not be up , so that we shall 
 have a clear field . besides , we must be prompt , for this marriage 
 may mean a complete change in her life and habits . i must wire to 
 the king without delay . " 

 we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door . he was 
 searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said : 

 " good - night , mister sherlock holmes . " 

 there were several people on the pavement at the time , but the 
 greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had 
 hurried by . 

 " i 've heard that voice before , " said holmes , staring down the 
 dimly lit street . " now , i wonder who the deuce that could have 
 been . " 


 iii . 

 i slept at baker street that night , and we were engaged upon our 
 toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed 
 into the room . 

 " you have really got it ! " he cried , grasping sherlock holmes by 
 either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face . 

 " not yet . " 

 " but you have hopes ? " 

 " i have hopes . " 

 " then , come . i am all impatience to be gone . " 

 " we must have a cab . " 

 " no , my brougham is waiting . " 

 " then that will simplify matters . " we descended and started off 
 once more for briony lodge . 

 " irene adler is married , " remarked holmes . 

 " married ! when ? " 

 " yesterday . " 

 " but to whom ? " 

 " to an english lawyer named norton . " 

 " but she could not love him . " 

 " i am in hopes that she does . " 

 " and why in hopes ? " 

 " because it would spare your majesty all fear of future 
 annoyance . if the lady loves her husband , she does not love your 
 majesty . if she does not love your majesty , there is no reason 
 why she should interfere with your majesty 's plan . " 

 " it is true . and yet -- well ! i wish she had been of my own 
 station ! what a queen she would have made ! " he relapsed into a 
 moody silence , which was not broken until we drew up in 
 serpentine avenue . 

 the door of briony lodge was open , and an elderly woman stood 
 upon the steps . she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped 
 from the brougham . 

 " mr. sherlock holmes , i believe ? " said she . 

 " i am mr. holmes , " answered my companion , looking at her with a 
 questioning and rather startled gaze . 

 " indeed ! my mistress told me that you were likely to call . she 
 left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing 
 cross for the continent . " 

 " what ! " sherlock holmes staggered back , white with chagrin and 
 surprise . " do you mean that she has left england ? " 

 " never to return . " 

 " and the papers ? " asked the king hoarsely . " all is lost . " 

 " we shall see . " he pushed past the servant and rushed into the 
 drawing - room , followed by the king and myself . the furniture was 
 scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and 
 open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before 
 her flight . holmes rushed at the bell - pull , tore back a small 
 sliding shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a 
 photograph and a letter . the photograph was of irene adler 
 herself in evening dress , the letter was superscribed to 
 " sherlock holmes , esq . to be left till called for . " my friend 
 tore it open and we all three read it together . it was dated at 
 midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way : 

 " my dear mr . sherlock holmes ,-- you really did it very well . you 
 took me in completely . until after the alarm of fire , i had not a 
 suspicion . but then , when i found how i had betrayed myself , i 
 began to think . i had been warned against you months ago . i had 
 been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly 
 be you . and your address had been given me . yet , with all this , 
 you made me reveal what you wanted to know . even after i became 
 suspicious , i found it hard to think evil of such a dear , kind 
 old clergyman . but , you know , i have been trained as an actress 
 myself . male costume is nothing new to me . i often take advantage 
 of the freedom which it gives . i sent john , the coachman , to 
 watch you , ran up stairs , got into my walking - clothes , as i call 
 them , and came down just as you departed . 

 " well , i followed you to your door , and so made sure that i was 
 really an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock 
 holmes . then i , rather imprudently , wished you good - night , and 
 started for the temple to see my husband . 

 " we both thought the best resource was flight , when pursued by 
 so formidable an antagonist ; so you will find the nest empty when 
 you call to - morrow . as to the photograph , your client may rest in 
 peace . i love and am loved by a better man than he . the king may 
 do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly 
 wronged . i keep it only to safeguard myself , and to preserve a 
 weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might 
 take in the future . i leave a photograph which he might care to 
 possess ; and i remain , dear mr. sherlock holmes , 

                                       " very truly yours , 
                                    " irene norton , née adler . " 

 " what a woman -- oh , what a woman ! " cried the king of bohemia , when 
 we had all three read this epistle . " did i not tell you how quick 
 and resolute she was ? would she not have made an admirable queen ? 
 is it not a pity that she was not on my level ? " 

 " from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a 
 very different level to your majesty , " said holmes coldly . " i am 
 sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty 's business 
 to a more successful conclusion . " 

 " on the contrary , my dear sir , " cried the king ; " nothing could be 
 more successful . i know that her word is inviolate . the 
 photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire . " 

 " i am glad to hear your majesty say so . " 

 " i am immensely indebted to you . pray tell me in what way i can 
 reward you . this ring-- " he slipped an emerald snake ring from 
 his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand . 

 " your majesty has something which i should value even more 
 highly , " said holmes . 

 " you have but to name it . " 

 " this photograph ! " 

 the king stared at him in amazement . 

 " irene 's photograph ! " he cried . " certainly , if you wish it . " 

 " i thank your majesty . then there is no more to be done in the 
 matter . i have the honour to wish you a very good - morning . " he 
 bowed , and , turning away without observing the hand which the 
 king had stretched out to him , he set off in my company for his 
 chambers . 

 and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom 
 of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were 
 beaten by a woman 's wit . he used to make merry over the 
 cleverness of women , but i have not heard him do it of late . and 
 when he speaks of irene adler , or when he refers to her 
 photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman . 



 adventure ii . the red - headed league 

 i had called upon my friend , mr. sherlock holmes , one day in the 
 autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a 
 very stout , florid - faced , elderly gentleman with fiery red hair . 
 with an apology for my intrusion , i was about to withdraw when 
 holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door 
 behind me . 

 " you could not possibly have come at a better time , my dear 
 watson , " he said cordially . 

 " i was afraid that you were engaged . " 

 " so i am . very much so . " 

 " then i can wait in the next room . " 

 " not at all . this gentleman , mr. wilson , has been my partner and 
 helper in many of my most successful cases , and i have no 
 doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also . " 

 the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of 
 greeting , with a quick little questioning glance from his small 
 fat - encircled eyes . 

 " try the settee , " said holmes , relapsing into his armchair and 
 putting his fingertips together , as was his custom when in 
 judicial moods . " i know , my dear watson , that you share my love 
 of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum 
 routine of everyday life . you have shown your relish for it by 
 the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle , and , if you 
 will excuse my saying so , somewhat to embellish so many of my own 
 little adventures . " 

 " your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me , " i 
 observed . 

 " you will remember that i remarked the other day , just before we 
 went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary 
 sutherland , that for strange effects and extraordinary 
 combinations we must go to life itself , which is always far more 
 daring than any effort of the imagination . " 

 " a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting . " 

 " you did , doctor , but none the less you must come round to my 
 view , for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you 
 until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to 
 be right . now , mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call 
 upon me this morning , and to begin a narrative which promises to 
 be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some 
 time . you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique 
 things are very often connected not with the larger but with the 
 smaller crimes , and occasionally , indeed , where there is room for 
 doubt whether any positive crime has been committed . as far as i 
 have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present 
 case is an instance of crime or not , but the course of events is 
 certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to . 
 perhaps , mr. wilson , you would have the great kindness to 
 recommence your narrative . i ask you not merely because my friend 
 dr. watson has not heard the opening part but also because the 
 peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every 
 possible detail from your lips . as a rule , when i have heard some 
 slight indication of the course of events , i am able to guide 
 myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my 
 memory . in the present instance i am forced to admit that the 
 facts are , to the best of my belief , unique . " 

 the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some 
 little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the 
 inside pocket of his greatcoat . as he glanced down the 
 advertisement column , with his head thrust forward and the paper 
 flattened out upon his knee , i took a good look at the man and 
 endeavoured , after the fashion of my companion , to read the 
 indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance . 

 i did not gain very much , however , by my inspection . our visitor 
 bore every mark of being an average commonplace british 
 tradesman , obese , pompous , and slow . he wore rather baggy grey 
 shepherd 's check trousers , a not over - clean black frock - coat , 
 unbuttoned in the front , and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy 
 albert chain , and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as 
 an ornament . a frayed top - hat and a faded brown overcoat with a 
 wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him . altogether , 
 look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save 
 his blazing red head , and the expression of extreme chagrin and 
 discontent upon his features . 

 sherlock holmes ' quick eye took in my occupation , and he shook 
 his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances . 
 " beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual 
 labour , that he takes snuff , that he is a freemason , that he has 
 been in china , and that he has done a considerable amount of 
 writing lately , i can deduce nothing else . " 

 mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair , with his forefinger 
 upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion . 

 " how , in the name of good - fortune , did you know all that , mr. 
 holmes ? " he asked . " how did you know , for example , that i did 
 manual labour . it 's as true as gospel , for i began as a ship 's 
 carpenter . " 

 " your hands , my dear sir . your right hand is quite a size larger 
 than your left . you have worked with it , and the muscles are more 
 developed . " 

 " well , the snuff , then , and the freemasonry ? " 

 " i wo n't insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that , 
 especially as , rather against the strict rules of your order , you 
 use an arc - and - compass breastpin . " 

 " ah , of course , i forgot that . but the writing ? " 

 " what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for 
 five inches , and the left one with the smooth patch near the 
 elbow where you rest it upon the desk ? " 

 " well , but china ? " 

 " the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right 
 wrist could only have been done in china . i have made a small 
 study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature 
 of the subject . that trick of staining the fishes ' scales of a 
 delicate pink is quite peculiar to china . when , in addition , i 
 see a chinese coin hanging from your watch - chain , the matter 
 becomes even more simple . " 

 mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily . " well , i never ! " said he . " i 
 thought at first that you had done something clever , but i see 
 that there was nothing in it , after all . " 

 " i begin to think , watson , " said holmes , " that i make a mistake 
 in explaining . ' omne ignotum pro magnifico , ' you know , and my 
 poor little reputation , such as it is , will suffer shipwreck if i 
 am so candid . can you not find the advertisement , mr. wilson ? " 

 " yes , i have got it now , " he answered with his thick red finger 
 planted halfway down the column . " here it is . this is what began 
 it all . you just read it for yourself , sir . " 

 i took the paper from him and read as follows : 

 " to the red - headed league : on account of the bequest of the late 
 ezekiah hopkins , of lebanon , pennsylvania , u. s. a. , there is now 
 another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a 
 salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services . all 
 red - headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age 
 of twenty - one years , are eligible . apply in person on monday , at 
 eleven o'clock , to duncan ross , at the offices of the league , 7 
 pope 's court , fleet street . " 

 " what on earth does this mean ? " i ejaculated after i had twice 
 read over the extraordinary announcement . 

 holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair , as was his habit when 
 in high spirits . " it is a little off the beaten track , is n't it ? " 
 said he . " and now , mr. wilson , off you go at scratch and tell us 
 all about yourself , your household , and the effect which this 
 advertisement had upon your fortunes . you will first make a note , 
 doctor , of the paper and the date . " 

 " it is the morning chronicle of april 27 , 1890 . just two months 
 ago . " 

 " very good . now , mr. wilson ? " 

 " well , it is just as i have been telling you , mr. sherlock 
 holmes , " said jabez wilson , mopping his forehead ; " i have a small 
 pawnbroker 's business at coburg square , near the city . it 's not a 
 very large affair , and of late years it has not done more than 
 just give me a living . i used to be able to keep two assistants , 
 but now i only keep one ; and i would have a job to pay him but 
 that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the 
 business . " 

 " what is the name of this obliging youth ? " asked sherlock holmes . 

 " his name is vincent spaulding , and he 's not such a youth , 
 either . it 's hard to say his age . i should not wish a smarter 
 assistant , mr. holmes ; and i know very well that he could better 
 himself and earn twice what i am able to give him . but , after 
 all , if he is satisfied , why should i put ideas in his head ? " 

 " why , indeed ? you seem most fortunate in having an employé who 
 comes under the full market price . it is not a common experience 
 among employers in this age . i do n't know that your assistant is 
 not as remarkable as your advertisement . " 

 " oh , he has his faults , too , " said mr. wilson . " never was such a 
 fellow for photography . snapping away with a camera when he ought 
 to be improving his mind , and then diving down into the cellar 
 like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures . that is his 
 main fault , but on the whole he 's a good worker . there 's no vice 
 in him . " 

 " he is still with you , i presume ? " 

 " yes , sir . he and a girl of fourteen , who does a bit of simple 
 cooking and keeps the place clean -- that 's all i have in the 
 house , for i am a widower and never had any family . we live very 
 quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a roof over our heads 
 and pay our debts , if we do nothing more . 

 " the first thing that put us out was that advertisement . 
 spaulding , he came down into the office just this day eight 
 weeks , with this very paper in his hand , and he says : 

 " ' i wish to the lord , mr. wilson , that i was a red - headed man . ' 

 " ' why that ? ' i asks . 

 " ' why , ' says he , ' here 's another vacancy on the league of the 
 red - headed men . it 's worth quite a little fortune to any man who 
 gets it , and i understand that there are more vacancies than 
 there are men , so that the trustees are at their wits ' end what 
 to do with the money . if my hair would only change colour , here 's 
 a nice little crib all ready for me to step into . ' 

 " ' why , what is it , then ? ' i asked . you see , mr. holmes , i am a 
 very stay - at - home man , and as my business came to me instead of 
 my having to go to it , i was often weeks on end without putting 
 my foot over the door - mat . in that way i did n't know much of what 
 was going on outside , and i was always glad of a bit of news . 

 " ' have you never heard of the league of the red - headed men ? ' he 
 asked with his eyes open . 

 " ' never . ' 

 " ' why , i wonder at that , for you are eligible yourself for one 
 of the vacancies . ' 

 " ' and what are they worth ? ' i asked . 

 " ' oh , merely a couple of hundred a year , but the work is slight , 
 and it need not interfere very much with one 's other 
 occupations . ' 

 " well , you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears , 
 for the business has not been over - good for some years , and an 
 extra couple of hundred would have been very handy . 

 " ' tell me all about it , ' said i. 

 " ' well , ' said he , showing me the advertisement , ' you can see for 
 yourself that the league has a vacancy , and there is the address 
 where you should apply for particulars . as far as i can make out , 
 the league was founded by an american millionaire , ezekiah 
 hopkins , who was very peculiar in his ways . he was himself 
 red - headed , and he had a great sympathy for all red - headed men ; 
 so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous 
 fortune in the hands of trustees , with instructions to apply the 
 interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of 
 that colour . from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to 
 do . ' 

 " ' but , ' said i , ' there would be millions of red - headed men who 
 would apply . ' 

 " ' not so many as you might think , ' he answered . ' you see it is 
 really confined to londoners , and to grown men . this american had 
 started from london when he was young , and he wanted to do the 
 old town a good turn . then , again , i have heard it is no use your 
 applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but 
 real bright , blazing , fiery red . now , if you cared to apply , mr. 
 wilson , you would just walk in ; but perhaps it would hardly be 
 worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a 
 few hundred pounds . ' 

 " now , it is a fact , gentlemen , as you may see for yourselves , 
 that my hair is of a very full and rich tint , so that it seemed 
 to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i 
 stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met . vincent 
 spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might 
 prove useful , so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for 
 the day and to come right away with me . he was very willing to 
 have a holiday , so we shut the business up and started off for 
 the address that was given us in the advertisement . 

 " i never hope to see such a sight as that again , mr. holmes . from 
 north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in 
 his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement . 
 fleet street was choked with red - headed folk , and pope 's court 
 looked like a coster 's orange barrow . i should not have thought 
 there were so many in the whole country as were brought together 
 by that single advertisement . every shade of colour they 
 were -- straw , lemon , orange , brick , irish - setter , liver , clay ; 
 but , as spaulding said , there were not many who had the real 
 vivid flame - coloured tint . when i saw how many were waiting , i 
 would have given it up in despair ; but spaulding would not hear 
 of it . how he did it i could not imagine , but he pushed and 
 pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up 
 to the steps which led to the office . there was a double stream 
 upon the stair , some going up in hope , and some coming back 
 dejected ; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found 
 ourselves in the office . " 

 " your experience has been a most entertaining one , " remarked 
 holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge 
 pinch of snuff . " pray continue your very interesting statement . " 

 " there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs 
 and a deal table , behind which sat a small man with a head that 
 was even redder than mine . he said a few words to each candidate 
 as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in 
 them which would disqualify them . getting a vacancy did not seem 
 to be such a very easy matter , after all . however , when our turn 
 came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of 
 the others , and he closed the door as we entered , so that he 
 might have a private word with us . 

 " ' this is mr. jabez wilson , ' said my assistant , ' and he is 
 willing to fill a vacancy in the league . ' 

 " ' and he is admirably suited for it , ' the other answered . ' he has 
 every requirement . i can not recall when i have seen anything so 
 fine . ' he took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and 
 gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful . then suddenly he 
 plunged forward , wrung my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my 
 success . 

 " ' it would be injustice to hesitate , ' said he . ' you will , 
 however , i am sure , excuse me for taking an obvious precaution . ' 
 with that he seized my hair in both his hands , and tugged until i 
 yelled with the pain . ' there is water in your eyes , ' said he as 
 he released me . ' i perceive that all is as it should be . but we 
 have to be careful , for we have twice been deceived by wigs and 
 once by paint . i could tell you tales of cobbler 's wax which 
 would disgust you with human nature . ' he stepped over to the 
 window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the 
 vacancy was filled . a groan of disappointment came up from below , 
 and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there 
 was not a red - head to be seen except my own and that of the 
 manager . 

 " ' my name , ' said he , ' is mr. duncan ross , and i am myself one of 
 the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor . are 
 you a married man , mr. wilson ? have you a family ? ' 

 " i answered that i had not . 

 " his face fell immediately . 

 " ' dear me ! ' he said gravely , ' that is very serious indeed ! i am 
 sorry to hear you say that . the fund was , of course , for the 
 propagation and spread of the red - heads as well as for their 
 maintenance . it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a 
 bachelor . ' 

 " my face lengthened at this , mr. holmes , for i thought that i was 
 not to have the vacancy after all ; but after thinking it over for 
 a few minutes he said that it would be all right . 

 " ' in the case of another , ' said he , ' the objection might be 
 fatal , but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a 
 head of hair as yours . when shall you be able to enter upon your 
 new duties ? ' 

 " ' well , it is a little awkward , for i have a business already , ' 
 said i. 

 " ' oh , never mind about that , mr. wilson ! ' said vincent spaulding . 
 ' i should be able to look after that for you . ' 

 " ' what would be the hours ? ' i asked . 

 " ' ten to two . ' 

 " now a pawnbroker 's business is mostly done of an evening , mr. 
 holmes , especially thursday and friday evening , which is just 
 before pay - day ; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in 
 the mornings . besides , i knew that my assistant was a good man , 
 and that he would see to anything that turned up . 

 " ' that would suit me very well , ' said i. ' and the pay ? ' 

 " ' is 4 pounds a week . ' 

 " ' and the work ? ' 

 " ' is purely nominal . ' 

 " ' what do you call purely nominal ? ' 

 " ' well , you have to be in the office , or at least in the 
 building , the whole time . if you leave , you forfeit your whole 
 position forever . the will is very clear upon that point . you 
 do n't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office 
 during that time . ' 

 " ' it 's only four hours a day , and i should not think of leaving , ' 
 said i. 

 " ' no excuse will avail , ' said mr. duncan ross ; ' neither sickness 
 nor business nor anything else . there you must stay , or you lose 
 your billet . ' 

 " ' and the work ? ' 

 " ' is to copy out the " encyclopaedia britannica . " there is the first 
 volume of it in that press . you must find your own ink , pens , and 
 blotting - paper , but we provide this table and chair . will you be 
 ready to - morrow ? ' 

 " ' certainly , ' i answered . 

 " ' then , good - bye , mr. jabez wilson , and let me congratulate you 
 once more on the important position which you have been fortunate 
 enough to gain . ' he bowed me out of the room and i went home with 
 my assistant , hardly knowing what to say or do , i was so pleased 
 at my own good fortune . 

 " well , i thought over the matter all day , and by evening i was in 
 low spirits again ; for i had quite persuaded myself that the 
 whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud , though what its 
 object might be i could not imagine . it seemed altogether past 
 belief that anyone could make such a will , or that they would pay 
 such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 
 ' encyclopaedia britannica . ' vincent spaulding did what he could to 
 cheer me up , but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the 
 whole thing . however , in the morning i determined to have a look 
 at it anyhow , so i bought a penny bottle of ink , and with a 
 quill - pen , and seven sheets of foolscap paper , i started off for 
 pope 's court . 

 " well , to my surprise and delight , everything was as right as 
 possible . the table was set out ready for me , and mr. duncan ross 
 was there to see that i got fairly to work . he started me off 
 upon the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would drop in from 
 time to time to see that all was right with me . at two o'clock he 
 bade me good - day , complimented me upon the amount that i had 
 written , and locked the door of the office after me . 

 " this went on day after day , mr. holmes , and on saturday the 
 manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my 
 week 's work . it was the same next week , and the same the week 
 after . every morning i was there at ten , and every afternoon i 
 left at two . by degrees mr. duncan ross took to coming in only 
 once of a morning , and then , after a time , he did not come in at 
 all . still , of course , i never dared to leave the room for an 
 instant , for i was not sure when he might come , and the billet 
 was such a good one , and suited me so well , that i would not risk 
 the loss of it . 

 " eight weeks passed away like this , and i had written about 
 abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica , and 
 hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b 's before very 
 long . it cost me something in foolscap , and i had pretty nearly 
 filled a shelf with my writings . and then suddenly the whole 
 business came to an end . " 

 " to an end ? " 

 " yes , sir . and no later than this morning . i went to my work as 
 usual at ten o'clock , but the door was shut and locked , with a 
 little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the 
 panel with a tack . here it is , and you can read for yourself . " 

 he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet 
 of note - paper . it read in this fashion : 

                   the red - headed league 

                            is 

                         dissolved . 

                      october 9 , 1890 . 

 sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the 
 rueful face behind it , until the comical side of the affair so 
 completely overtopped every other consideration that we both 
 burst out into a roar of laughter . 

 " i can not see that there is anything very funny , " cried our 
 client , flushing up to the roots of his flaming head . " if you can 
 do nothing better than laugh at me , i can go elsewhere . " 

 " no , no , " cried holmes , shoving him back into the chair from 
 which he had half risen . " i really would n't miss your case for 
 the world . it is most refreshingly unusual . but there is , if you 
 will excuse my saying so , something just a little funny about it . 
 pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the 
 door ? " 

 " i was staggered , sir . i did not know what to do . then i called 
 at the offices round , but none of them seemed to know anything 
 about it . finally , i went to the landlord , who is an accountant 
 living on the ground - floor , and i asked him if he could tell me 
 what had become of the red - headed league . he said that he had 
 never heard of any such body . then i asked him who mr. duncan 
 ross was . he answered that the name was new to him . 

 " ' well , ' said i , ' the gentleman at no . 4 . ' 

 " ' what , the red - headed man ? ' 

 " ' yes . ' 

 " ' oh , ' said he , ' his name was william morris . he was a solicitor 
 and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new 
 premises were ready . he moved out yesterday . ' 

 " ' where could i find him ? ' 

 " ' oh , at his new offices . he did tell me the address . yes , 17 
 king edward street , near st. paul 's . ' 

 " i started off , mr. holmes , but when i got to that address it was 
 a manufactory of artificial knee - caps , and no one in it had ever 
 heard of either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross . " 

 " and what did you do then ? " asked holmes . 

 " i went home to saxe - coburg square , and i took the advice of my 
 assistant . but he could not help me in any way . he could only say 
 that if i waited i should hear by post . but that was not quite 
 good enough , mr. holmes . i did not wish to lose such a place 
 without a struggle , so , as i had heard that you were good enough 
 to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it , i came right 
 away to you . " 

 " and you did very wisely , " said holmes . " your case is an 
 exceedingly remarkable one , and i shall be happy to look into it . 
 from what you have told me i think that it is possible that 
 graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear . " 

 " grave enough ! " said mr. jabez wilson . " why , i have lost four 
 pound a week . " 

 " as far as you are personally concerned , " remarked holmes , " i do 
 not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary 
 league . on the contrary , you are , as i understand , richer by some 
 30 pounds , to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have 
 gained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you have 
 lost nothing by them . " 

 " no , sir . but i want to find out about them , and who they are , 
 and what their object was in playing this prank -- if it was a 
 prank -- upon me . it was a pretty expensive joke for them , for it 
 cost them two and thirty pounds . " 

 " we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you . and , first , 
 one or two questions , mr. wilson . this assistant of yours who 
 first called your attention to the advertisement -- how long had he 
 been with you ? " 

 " about a month then . " 

 " how did he come ? " 

 " in answer to an advertisement . " 

 " was he the only applicant ? " 

 " no , i had a dozen . " 

 " why did you pick him ? " 

 " because he was handy and would come cheap . " 

 " at half - wages , in fact . " 

 " yes . " 

 " what is he like , this vincent spaulding ? " 

 " small , stout - built , very quick in his ways , no hair on his face , 
 though he 's not short of thirty . has a white splash of acid upon 
 his forehead . " 

 holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement . " i thought 
 as much , " said he . " have you ever observed that his ears are 
 pierced for earrings ? " 

 " yes , sir . he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he 
 was a lad . " 

 " hum ! " said holmes , sinking back in deep thought . " he is still 
 with you ? " 

 " oh , yes , sir ; i have only just left him . " 

 " and has your business been attended to in your absence ? " 

 " nothing to complain of , sir . there 's never very much to do of a 
 morning . " 

 " that will do , mr. wilson . i shall be happy to give you an 
 opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two . to - day is 
 saturday , and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion . " 

 " well , watson , " said holmes when our visitor had left us , " what 
 do you make of it all ? " 

 " i make nothing of it , " i answered frankly . " it is a most 
 mysterious business . " 

 " as a rule , " said holmes , " the more bizarre a thing is the less 
 mysterious it proves to be . it is your commonplace , featureless 
 crimes which are really puzzling , just as a commonplace face is 
 the most difficult to identify . but i must be prompt over this 
 matter . " 

 " what are you going to do , then ? " i asked . 

 " to smoke , " he answered . " it is quite a three pipe problem , and i 
 beg that you wo n't speak to me for fifty minutes . " he curled 
 himself up in his chair , with his thin knees drawn up to his 
 hawk - like nose , and there he sat with his eyes closed and his 
 black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird . 
 i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep , and 
 indeed was nodding myself , when he suddenly sprang out of his 
 chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put 
 his pipe down upon the mantelpiece . 

 " sarasate plays at the st. james 's hall this afternoon , " he 
 remarked . " what do you think , watson ? could your patients spare 
 you for a few hours ? " 

 " i have nothing to do to - day . my practice is never very 
 absorbing . " 

 " then put on your hat and come . i am going through the city 
 first , and we can have some lunch on the way . i observe that 
 there is a good deal of german music on the programme , which is 
 rather more to my taste than italian or french . it is 
 introspective , and i want to introspect . come along ! " 

 we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate ; and a short 
 walk took us to saxe - coburg square , the scene of the singular 
 story which we had listened to in the morning . it was a poky , 
 little , shabby - genteel place , where four lines of dingy 
 two - storied brick houses looked out into a small railed - in 
 enclosure , where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded 
 laurel - bushes made a hard fight against a smoke - laden and 
 uncongenial atmosphere . three gilt balls and a brown board with 
 " jabez wilson " in white letters , upon a corner house , announced 
 the place where our red - headed client carried on his business . 
 sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side 
 and looked it all over , with his eyes shining brightly between 
 puckered lids . then he walked slowly up the street , and then down 
 again to the corner , still looking keenly at the houses . finally 
 he returned to the pawnbroker 's , and , having thumped vigorously 
 upon the pavement with his stick two or three times , he went up 
 to the door and knocked . it was instantly opened by a 
 bright - looking , clean - shaven young fellow , who asked him to step 
 in . 

 " thank you , " said holmes , " i only wished to ask you how you would 
 go from here to the strand . " 

 " third right , fourth left , " answered the assistant promptly , 
 closing the door . 

 " smart fellow , that , " observed holmes as we walked away . " he is , 
 in my judgment , the fourth smartest man in london , and for daring 
 i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third . i have known 
 something of him before . " 

 " evidently , " said i , " mr. wilson 's assistant counts for a good 
 deal in this mystery of the red - headed league . i am sure that you 
 inquired your way merely in order that you might see him . " 

 " not him . " 

 " what then ? " 

 " the knees of his trousers . " 

 " and what did you see ? " 

 " what i expected to see . " 

 " why did you beat the pavement ? " 

 " my dear doctor , this is a time for observation , not for talk . we 
 are spies in an enemy 's country . we know something of saxe - coburg 
 square . let us now explore the parts which lie behind it . " 

 the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the 
 corner from the retired saxe - coburg square presented as great a 
 contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back . it was 
 one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city 
 to the north and west . the roadway was blocked with the immense 
 stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , 
 while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of 
 pedestrians . it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line 
 of fine shops and stately business premises that they really 
 abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square 
 which we had just quitted . 

 " let me see , " said holmes , standing at the corner and glancing 
 along the line , " i should like just to remember the order of the 
 houses here . it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of 
 london . there is mortimer 's , the tobacconist , the little 
 newspaper shop , the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank , 
 the vegetarian restaurant , and mcfarlane 's carriage - building 
 depot . that carries us right on to the other block . and now , 
 doctor , we 've done our work , so it 's time we had some play . a 
 sandwich and a cup of coffee , and then off to violin - land , where 
 all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony , and there are no 
 red - headed clients to vex us with their conundrums . " 

 my friend was an enthusiastic musician , being himself not only a 
 very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit . all 
 the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect 
 happiness , gently waving his long , thin fingers in time to the 
 music , while his gently smiling face and his languid , dreamy eyes 
 were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth - hound , holmes the 
 relentless , keen - witted , ready - handed criminal agent , as it was 
 possible to conceive . in his singular character the dual nature 
 alternately asserted itself , and his extreme exactness and 
 astuteness represented , as i have often thought , the reaction 
 against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally 
 predominated in him . the swing of his nature took him from 
 extreme languor to devouring energy ; and , as i knew well , he was 
 never so truly formidable as when , for days on end , he had been 
 lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his 
 black - letter editions . then it was that the lust of the chase 
 would suddenly come upon him , and that his brilliant reasoning 
 power would rise to the level of intuition , until those who were 
 unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a 
 man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals . when i saw him 
 that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st. james 's hall i 
 felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set 
 himself to hunt down . 

 " you want to go home , no doubt , doctor , " he remarked as we 
 emerged . 

 " yes , it would be as well . " 

 " and i have some business to do which will take some hours . this 
 business at coburg square is serious . " 

 " why serious ? " 

 " a considerable crime is in contemplation . i have every reason to 
 believe that we shall be in time to stop it . but to - day being 
 saturday rather complicates matters . i shall want your help 
 to - night . " 

 " at what time ? " 

 " ten will be early enough . " 

 " i shall be at baker street at ten . " 

 " very well . and , i say , doctor , there may be some little danger , 
 so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket . " he waved his 
 hand , turned on his heel , and disappeared in an instant among the 
 crowd . 

 i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours , but i was 
 always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings 
 with sherlock holmes . here i had heard what he had heard , i had 
 seen what he had seen , and yet from his words it was evident that 
 he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to 
 happen , while to me the whole business was still confused and 
 grotesque . as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought 
 over it all , from the extraordinary story of the red - headed 
 copier of the " encyclopaedia " down to the visit to saxe - coburg 
 square , and the ominous words with which he had parted from me . 
 what was this nocturnal expedition , and why should i go armed ? 
 where were we going , and what were we to do ? i had the hint from 
 holmes that this smooth - faced pawnbroker 's assistant was a 
 formidable man -- a man who might play a deep game . i tried to 
 puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside 
 until night should bring an explanation . 

 it was a quarter - past nine when i started from home and made my 
 way across the park , and so through oxford street to baker 
 street . two hansoms were standing at the door , and as i entered 
 the passage i heard the sound of voices from above . on entering 
 his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men , 
 one of whom i recognised as peter jones , the official police 
 agent , while the other was a long , thin , sad - faced man , with a 
 very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock - coat . 

 " ha ! our party is complete , " said holmes , buttoning up his 
 pea - jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack . 
 " watson , i think you know mr. jones , of scotland yard ? let me 
 introduce you to mr. merryweather , who is to be our companion in 
 to - night 's adventure . " 

 " we 're hunting in couples again , doctor , you see , " said jones in 
 his consequential way . " our friend here is a wonderful man for 
 starting a chase . all he wants is an old dog to help him to do 
 the running down . " 

 " i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase , " 
 observed mr. merryweather gloomily . 

 " you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes , sir , " said 
 the police agent loftily . " he has his own little methods , which 
 are , if he wo n't mind my saying so , just a little too theoretical 
 and fantastic , but he has the makings of a detective in him . it 
 is not too much to say that once or twice , as in that business of 
 the sholto murder and the agra treasure , he has been more nearly 
 correct than the official force . " 

 " oh , if you say so , mr. jones , it is all right , " said the 
 stranger with deference . " still , i confess that i miss my rubber . 
 it is the first saturday night for seven - and - twenty years that i 
 have not had my rubber . " 

 " i think you will find , " said sherlock holmes , " that you will 
 play for a higher stake to - night than you have ever done yet , and 
 that the play will be more exciting . for you , mr. merryweather , 
 the stake will be some 30,000 pounds ; and for you , jones , it will 
 be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands . " 

 " john clay , the murderer , thief , smasher , and forger . he 's a 
 young man , mr. merryweather , but he is at the head of his 
 profession , and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on 
 any criminal in london . he 's a remarkable man , is young john 
 clay . his grandfather was a royal duke , and he himself has been 
 to eton and oxford . his brain is as cunning as his fingers , and 
 though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to 
 find the man himself . he 'll crack a crib in scotland one week , 
 and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next . 
 i 've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him 
 yet . " 

 " i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to - night . 
 i 've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay , and i 
 agree with you that he is at the head of his profession . it is 
 past ten , however , and quite time that we started . if you two 
 will take the first hansom , watson and i will follow in the 
 second . " 

 sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive 
 and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in 
 the afternoon . we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas - lit 
 streets until we emerged into farrington street . 

 " we are close there now , " my friend remarked . " this fellow 
 merryweather is a bank director , and personally interested in the 
 matter . i thought it as well to have jones with us also . he is 
 not a bad fellow , though an absolute imbecile in his profession . 
 he has one positive virtue . he is as brave as a bulldog and as 
 tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone . here we 
 are , and they are waiting for us . " 

 we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had 
 found ourselves in the morning . our cabs were dismissed , and , 
 following the guidance of mr. merryweather , we passed down a 
 narrow passage and through a side door , which he opened for us . 
 within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very massive 
 iron gate . this also was opened , and led down a flight of winding 
 stone steps , which terminated at another formidable gate . mr. 
 merryweather stopped to light a lantern , and then conducted us 
 down a dark , earth - smelling passage , and so , after opening a 
 third door , into a huge vault or cellar , which was piled all 
 round with crates and massive boxes . 

 " you are not very vulnerable from above , " holmes remarked as he 
 held up the lantern and gazed about him . 

 " nor from below , " said mr. merryweather , striking his stick upon 
 the flags which lined the floor . " why , dear me , it sounds quite 
 hollow ! " he remarked , looking up in surprise . 

 " i must really ask you to be a little more quiet ! " said holmes 
 severely . " you have already imperilled the whole success of our 
 expedition . might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit 
 down upon one of those boxes , and not to interfere ? " 

 the solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate , with a 
 very injured expression upon his face , while holmes fell upon his 
 knees upon the floor and , with the lantern and a magnifying lens , 
 began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones . a few 
 seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he sprang to his feet again 
 and put his glass in his pocket . 

 " we have at least an hour before us , " he remarked , " for they can 
 hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed . 
 then they will not lose a minute , for the sooner they do their 
 work the longer time they will have for their escape . we are at 
 present , doctor -- as no doubt you have divined -- in the cellar of 
 the city branch of one of the principal london banks . mr. 
 merryweather is the chairman of directors , and he will explain to 
 you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of 
 london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at 
 present . " 

 " it is our french gold , " whispered the director . " we have had 
 several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it . " 

 " your french gold ? " 

 " yes . we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources 
 and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of 
 france . it has become known that we have never had occasion to 
 unpack the money , and that it is still lying in our cellar . the 
 crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between 
 layers of lead foil . our reserve of bullion is much larger at 
 present than is usually kept in a single branch office , and the 
 directors have had misgivings upon the subject . " 

 " which were very well justified , " observed holmes . " and now it is 
 time that we arranged our little plans . i expect that within an 
 hour matters will come to a head . in the meantime mr. 
 merryweather , we must put the screen over that dark lantern . " 

 " and sit in the dark ? " 

 " i am afraid so . i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket , and 
 i thought that , as we were a partie carrée , you might have your 
 rubber after all . but i see that the enemy 's preparations have 
 gone so far that we can not risk the presence of a light . and , 
 first of all , we must choose our positions . these are daring men , 
 and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us 
 some harm unless we are careful . i shall stand behind this crate , 
 and do you conceal yourselves behind those . then , when i flash a 
 light upon them , close in swiftly . if they fire , watson , have no 
 compunction about shooting them down . " 

 i placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the wooden case 
 behind which i crouched . holmes shot the slide across the front 
 of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness -- such an absolute 
 darkness as i have never before experienced . the smell of hot 
 metal remained to assure us that the light was still there , ready 
 to flash out at a moment 's notice . to me , with my nerves worked 
 up to a pitch of expectancy , there was something depressing and 
 subduing in the sudden gloom , and in the cold dank air of the 
 vault . 

 " they have but one retreat , " whispered holmes . " that is back 
 through the house into saxe - coburg square . i hope that you have 
 done what i asked you , jones ? " 

 " i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door . " 

 " then we have stopped all the holes . and now we must be silent 
 and wait . " 

 what a time it seemed ! from comparing notes afterwards it was but 
 an hour and a quarter , yet it appeared to me that the night must 
 have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us . my limbs 
 were weary and stiff , for i feared to change my position ; yet my 
 nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension , and my 
 hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle 
 breathing of my companions , but i could distinguish the deeper , 
 heavier in - breath of the bulky jones from the thin , sighing note 
 of the bank director . from my position i could look over the case 
 in the direction of the floor . suddenly my eyes caught the glint 
 of a light . 

 at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement . then 
 it lengthened out until it became a yellow line , and then , 
 without any warning or sound , a gash seemed to open and a hand 
 appeared , a white , almost womanly hand , which felt about in the 
 centre of the little area of light . for a minute or more the 
 hand , with its writhing fingers , protruded out of the floor . then 
 it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared , and all was dark 
 again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between 
 the stones . 

 its disappearance , however , was but momentary . with a rending , 
 tearing sound , one of the broad , white stones turned over upon 
 its side and left a square , gaping hole , through which streamed 
 the light of a lantern . over the edge there peeped a clean - cut , 
 boyish face , which looked keenly about it , and then , with a hand 
 on either side of the aperture , drew itself shoulder - high and 
 waist - high , until one knee rested upon the edge . in another 
 instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after 
 him a companion , lithe and small like himself , with a pale face 
 and a shock of very red hair . 

 " it 's all clear , " he whispered . " have you the chisel and the 
 bags ? great scott ! jump , archie , jump , and i 'll swing for it ! " 

 sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the 
 collar . the other dived down the hole , and i heard the sound of 
 rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts . the light flashed 
 upon the barrel of a revolver , but holmes ' hunting crop came 
 down on the man 's wrist , and the pistol clinked upon the stone 
 floor . 

 " it 's no use , john clay , " said holmes blandly . " you have no 
 chance at all . " 

 " so i see , " the other answered with the utmost coolness . " i fancy 
 that my pal is all right , though i see you have got his 
 coat - tails . " 

 " there are three men waiting for him at the door , " said holmes . 

 " oh , indeed ! you seem to have done the thing very completely . i 
 must compliment you . " 

 " and i you , " holmes answered . " your red - headed idea was very new 
 and effective . " 

 " you 'll see your pal again presently , " said jones . " he 's quicker 
 at climbing down holes than i am . just hold out while i fix the 
 derbies . " 

 " i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands , " 
 remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists . 
 " you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins . have 
 the goodness , also , when you address me always to say ' sir ' and 
 ' please . ' " 

 " all right , " said jones with a stare and a snigger . " well , would 
 you please , sir , march upstairs , where we can get a cab to carry 
 your highness to the police - station ? " 

 " that is better , " said john clay serenely . he made a sweeping bow 
 to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the 
 detective . 

 " really , mr. holmes , " said mr. merryweather as we followed them 
 from the cellar , " i do not know how the bank can thank you or 
 repay you . there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated 
 in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts 
 at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience . " 

 " i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. 
 john clay , " said holmes . " i have been at some small expense over 
 this matter , which i shall expect the bank to refund , but beyond 
 that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in 
 many ways unique , and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of 
 the red - headed league . " 


 " you see , watson , " he explained in the early hours of the morning 
 as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street , " it 
 was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible 
 object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of 
 the league , and the copying of the ' encyclopaedia , ' must be to get 
 this not over - bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of 
 hours every day . it was a curious way of managing it , but , 
 really , it would be difficult to suggest a better . the method was 
 no doubt suggested to clay 's ingenious mind by the colour of his 
 accomplice 's hair . the 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw 
 him , and what was it to them , who were playing for thousands ? 
 they put in the advertisement , one rogue has the temporary 
 office , the other rogue incites the man to apply for it , and 
 together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the 
 week . from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for 
 half wages , it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive 
 for securing the situation . " 

 " but how could you guess what the motive was ? " 

 " had there been women in the house , i should have suspected a 
 mere vulgar intrigue . that , however , was out of the question . the 
 man 's business was a small one , and there was nothing in his 
 house which could account for such elaborate preparations , and 
 such an expenditure as they were at . it must , then , be something 
 out of the house . what could it be ? i thought of the assistant 's 
 fondness for photography , and his trick of vanishing into the 
 cellar . the cellar ! there was the end of this tangled clue . then 
 i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i 
 had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in 
 london . he was doing something in the cellar -- something which 
 took many hours a day for months on end . what could it be , once 
 more ? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel 
 to some other building . 

 " so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action . i 
 surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick . i was 
 ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind . 
 it was not in front . then i rang the bell , and , as i hoped , the 
 assistant answered it . we have had some skirmishes , but we had 
 never set eyes upon each other before . i hardly looked at his 
 face . his knees were what i wished to see . you must yourself have 
 remarked how worn , wrinkled , and stained they were . they spoke of 
 those hours of burrowing . the only remaining point was what they 
 were burrowing for . i walked round the corner , saw the city and 
 suburban bank abutted on our friend 's premises , and felt that i 
 had solved my problem . when you drove home after the concert i 
 called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank 
 directors , with the result that you have seen . " 

 " and how could you tell that they would make their attempt 
 to - night ? " i asked . 

 " well , when they closed their league offices that was a sign that 
 they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson 's presence -- in other 
 words , that they had completed their tunnel . but it was essential 
 that they should use it soon , as it might be discovered , or the 
 bullion might be removed . saturday would suit them better than 
 any other day , as it would give them two days for their escape . 
 for all these reasons i expected them to come to - night . " 

 " you reasoned it out beautifully , " i exclaimed in unfeigned 
 admiration . " it is so long a chain , and yet every link rings 
 true . " 

 " it saved me from ennui , " he answered , yawning . " alas ! i already 
 feel it closing in upon me . my life is spent in one long effort 
 to escape from the commonplaces of existence . these little 
 problems help me to do so . " 

 " and you are a benefactor of the race , " said i. 

 he shrugged his shoulders . " well , perhaps , after all , it is of 
 some little use , " he remarked . " ' l'homme c'est rien -- l'oeuvre 
 c'est tout , ' as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand . " 



 adventure iii . a case of identity 

 " my dear fellow , " said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side 
 of the fire in his lodgings at baker street , " life is infinitely 
 stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent . we 
 would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere 
 commonplaces of existence . if we could fly out of that window 
 hand in hand , hover over this great city , gently remove the 
 roofs , and peep in at the queer things which are going on , the 
 strange coincidences , the plannings , the cross - purposes , the 
 wonderful chains of events , working through generations , and 
 leading to the most outré results , it would make all fiction with 
 its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and 
 unprofitable . " 

 " and yet i am not convinced of it , " i answered . " the cases which 
 come to light in the papers are , as a rule , bald enough , and 
 vulgar enough . we have in our police reports realism pushed to 
 its extreme limits , and yet the result is , it must be confessed , 
 neither fascinating nor artistic . " 

 " a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a 
 realistic effect , " remarked holmes . " this is wanting in the 
 police report , where more stress is laid , perhaps , upon the 
 platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details , which to an 
 observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter . depend 
 upon it , there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace . " 

 i smiled and shook my head . " i can quite understand your thinking 
 so , " i said . " of course , in your position of unofficial adviser 
 and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled , throughout 
 three continents , you are brought in contact with all that is 
 strange and bizarre . but here "-- i picked up the morning paper 
 from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test . here is the 
 first heading upon which i come . ' a husband 's cruelty to his 
 wife . ' there is half a column of print , but i know without 
 reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me . there is , of 
 course , the other woman , the drink , the push , the blow , the 
 bruise , the sympathetic sister or landlady . the crudest of 
 writers could invent nothing more crude . " 

 " indeed , your example is an unfortunate one for your argument , " 
 said holmes , taking the paper and glancing his eye down it . " this 
 is the dundas separation case , and , as it happens , i was engaged 
 in clearing up some small points in connection with it . the 
 husband was a teetotaler , there was no other woman , and the 
 conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of 
 winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling 
 them at his wife , which , you will allow , is not an action likely 
 to occur to the imagination of the average story - teller . take a 
 pinch of snuff , doctor , and acknowledge that i have scored over 
 you in your example . " 

 he held out his snuffbox of old gold , with a great amethyst in 
 the centre of the lid . its splendour was in such contrast to his 
 homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon 
 it . 

 " ah , " said he , " i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks . 
 it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my 
 assistance in the case of the irene adler papers . " 

 " and the ring ? " i asked , glancing at a remarkable brilliant which 
 sparkled upon his finger . 

 " it was from the reigning family of holland , though the matter in 
 which i served them was of such delicacy that i can not confide it 
 even to you , who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of 
 my little problems . " 

 " and have you any on hand just now ? " i asked with interest . 

 " some ten or twelve , but none which present any feature of 
 interest . they are important , you understand , without being 
 interesting . indeed , i have found that it is usually in 
 unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation , 
 and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the 
 charm to an investigation . the larger crimes are apt to be the 
 simpler , for the bigger the crime the more obvious , as a rule , is 
 the motive . in these cases , save for one rather intricate matter 
 which has been referred to me from marseilles , there is nothing 
 which presents any features of interest . it is possible , however , 
 that i may have something better before very many minutes are 
 over , for this is one of my clients , or i am much mistaken . " 

 he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted 
 blinds gazing down into the dull neutral - tinted london street . 
 looking over his shoulder , i saw that on the pavement opposite 
 there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck , 
 and a large curling red feather in a broad - brimmed hat which was 
 tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her 
 ear . from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous , 
 hesitating fashion at our windows , while her body oscillated 
 backward and forward , and her fingers fidgeted with her glove 
 buttons . suddenly , with a plunge , as of the swimmer who leaves 
 the bank , she hurried across the road , and we heard the sharp 
 clang of the bell . 

 " i have seen those symptoms before , " said holmes , throwing his 
 cigarette into the fire . " oscillation upon the pavement always 
 means an affaire de coeur . she would like advice , but is not sure 
 that the matter is not too delicate for communication . and yet 
 even here we may discriminate . when a woman has been seriously 
 wronged by a man she no longer oscillates , and the usual symptom 
 is a broken bell wire . here we may take it that there is a love 
 matter , but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed , or 
 grieved . but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts . " 

 as he spoke there was a tap at the door , and the boy in buttons 
 entered to announce miss mary sutherland , while the lady herself 
 loomed behind his small black figure like a full - sailed 
 merchant - man behind a tiny pilot boat . sherlock holmes welcomed 
 her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable , and , 
 having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair , he looked 
 her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was 
 peculiar to him . 

 " do you not find , " he said , " that with your short sight it is a 
 little trying to do so much typewriting ? " 

 " i did at first , " she answered , " but now i know where the letters 
 are without looking . " then , suddenly realising the full purport 
 of his words , she gave a violent start and looked up , with fear 
 and astonishment upon her broad , good - humoured face . " you 've 
 heard about me , mr. holmes , " she cried , " else how could you know 
 all that ? " 

 " never mind , " said holmes , laughing ; " it is my business to know 
 things . perhaps i have trained myself to see what others 
 overlook . if not , why should you come to consult me ? " 

 " i came to you , sir , because i heard of you from mrs. etherege , 
 whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had 
 given him up for dead . oh , mr. holmes , i wish you would do as 
 much for me . i 'm not rich , but still i have a hundred a year in 
 my own right , besides the little that i make by the machine , and 
 i would give it all to know what has become of mr. hosmer angel . " 

 " why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry ? " asked 
 sherlock holmes , with his finger - tips together and his eyes to 
 the ceiling . 

 again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss 
 mary sutherland . " yes , i did bang out of the house , " she said , 
 " for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr. 
 windibank -- that is , my father -- took it all . he would not go to 
 the police , and he would not go to you , and so at last , as he 
 would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done , 
 it made me mad , and i just on with my things and came right away 
 to you . " 

 " your father , " said holmes , " your stepfather , surely , since the 
 name is different . " 

 " yes , my stepfather . i call him father , though it sounds funny , 
 too , for he is only five years and two months older than myself . " 

 " and your mother is alive ? " 

 " oh , yes , mother is alive and well . i was n't best pleased , mr. 
 holmes , when she married again so soon after father 's death , and 
 a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself . father 
 was a plumber in the tottenham court road , and he left a tidy 
 business behind him , which mother carried on with mr. hardy , the 
 foreman ; but when mr. windibank came he made her sell the 
 business , for he was very superior , being a traveller in wines . 
 they got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest , which was n't 
 near as much as father could have got if he had been alive . " 

 i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this 
 rambling and inconsequential narrative , but , on the contrary , he 
 had listened with the greatest concentration of attention . 

 " your own little income , " he asked , " does it come out of the 
 business ? " 

 " oh , no , sir . it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle 
 ned in auckland . it is in new zealand stock , paying 4 1/2 per 
 cent . two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount , but i can 
 only touch the interest . " 

 " you interest me extremely , " said holmes . " and since you draw so 
 large a sum as a hundred a year , with what you earn into the 
 bargain , you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in 
 every way . i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely 
 upon an income of about 60 pounds . " 

 " i could do with much less than that , mr. holmes , but you 
 understand that as long as i live at home i do n't wish to be a 
 burden to them , and so they have the use of the money just while 
 i am staying with them . of course , that is only just for the 
 time . mr. windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it 
 over to mother , and i find that i can do pretty well with what i 
 earn at typewriting . it brings me twopence a sheet , and i can 
 often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day . " 

 " you have made your position very clear to me , " said holmes . 
 " this is my friend , dr. watson , before whom you can speak as 
 freely as before myself . kindly tell us now all about your 
 connection with mr. hosmer angel . " 

 a flush stole over miss sutherland 's face , and she picked 
 nervously at the fringe of her jacket . " i met him first at the 
 gasfitters ' ball , " she said . " they used to send father tickets 
 when he was alive , and then afterwards they remembered us , and 
 sent them to mother . mr. windibank did not wish us to go . he 
 never did wish us to go anywhere . he would get quite mad if i 
 wanted so much as to join a sunday - school treat . but this time i 
 was set on going , and i would go ; for what right had he to 
 prevent ? he said the folk were not fit for us to know , when all 
 father 's friends were to be there . and he said that i had nothing 
 fit to wear , when i had my purple plush that i had never so much 
 as taken out of the drawer . at last , when nothing else would do , 
 he went off to france upon the business of the firm , but we went , 
 mother and i , with mr. hardy , who used to be our foreman , and it 
 was there i met mr. hosmer angel . " 

 " i suppose , " said holmes , " that when mr. windibank came back from 
 france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball . " 

 " oh , well , he was very good about it . he laughed , i remember , and 
 shrugged his shoulders , and said there was no use denying 
 anything to a woman , for she would have her way . " 

 " i see . then at the gasfitters ' ball you met , as i understand , a 
 gentleman called mr. hosmer angel . " 

 " yes , sir . i met him that night , and he called next day to ask if 
 we had got home all safe , and after that we met him -- that is to 
 say , mr. holmes , i met him twice for walks , but after that father 
 came back again , and mr. hosmer angel could not come to the house 
 any more . " 

 " no ? " 

 " well , you know father did n't like anything of the sort . he 
 would n't have any visitors if he could help it , and he used to 
 say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle . but 
 then , as i used to say to mother , a woman wants her own circle to 
 begin with , and i had not got mine yet . " 

 " but how about mr. hosmer angel ? did he make no attempt to see 
 you ? " 

 " well , father was going off to france again in a week , and hosmer 
 wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each 
 other until he had gone . we could write in the meantime , and he 
 used to write every day . i took the letters in in the morning , so 
 there was no need for father to know . " 

 " were you engaged to the gentleman at this time ? " 

 " oh , yes , mr. holmes . we were engaged after the first walk that 
 we took . hosmer -- mr . angel -- was a cashier in an office in 
 leadenhall street -- and-- " 

 " what office ? " 

 " that 's the worst of it , mr. holmes , i do n't know . " 

 " where did he live , then ? " 

 " he slept on the premises . " 

 " and you do n't know his address ? " 

 " no -- except that it was leadenhall street . " 

 " where did you address your letters , then ? " 

 " to the leadenhall street post office , to be left till called 
 for . he said that if they were sent to the office he would be 
 chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady , 
 so i offered to typewrite them , like he did his , but he would n't 
 have that , for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come 
 from me , but when they were typewritten he always felt that the 
 machine had come between us . that will just show you how fond he 
 was of me , mr. holmes , and the little things that he would think 
 of . " 

 " it was most suggestive , " said holmes . " it has long been an axiom 
 of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important . 
 can you remember any other little things about mr. hosmer angel ? " 

 " he was a very shy man , mr. holmes . he would rather walk with me 
 in the evening than in the daylight , for he said that he hated to 
 be conspicuous . very retiring and gentlemanly he was . even his 
 voice was gentle . he 'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he 
 was young , he told me , and it had left him with a weak throat , 
 and a hesitating , whispering fashion of speech . he was always 
 well dressed , very neat and plain , but his eyes were weak , just 
 as mine are , and he wore tinted glasses against the glare . " 

 " well , and what happened when mr. windibank , your stepfather , 
 returned to france ? " 

 " mr. hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we 
 should marry before father came back . he was in dreadful earnest 
 and made me swear , with my hands on the testament , that whatever 
 happened i would always be true to him . mother said he was quite 
 right to make me swear , and that it was a sign of his passion . 
 mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder 
 of him than i was . then , when they talked of marrying within the 
 week , i began to ask about father ; but they both said never to 
 mind about father , but just to tell him afterwards , and mother 
 said she would make it all right with him . i did n't quite like 
 that , mr. holmes . it seemed funny that i should ask his leave , as 
 he was only a few years older than me ; but i did n't want to do 
 anything on the sly , so i wrote to father at bordeaux , where the 
 company has its french offices , but the letter came back to me on 
 the very morning of the wedding . " 

 " it missed him , then ? " 

 " yes , sir ; for he had started to england just before it arrived . " 

 " ha ! that was unfortunate . your wedding was arranged , then , for 
 the friday . was it to be in church ? " 

 " yes , sir , but very quietly . it was to be at st. saviour 's , near 
 king 's cross , and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st. 
 pancras hotel . hosmer came for us in a hansom , but as there were 
 two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a 
 four - wheeler , which happened to be the only other cab in the 
 street . we got to the church first , and when the four - wheeler 
 drove up we waited for him to step out , but he never did , and 
 when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one 
 there ! the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become 
 of him , for he had seen him get in with his own eyes . that was 
 last friday , mr. holmes , and i have never seen or heard anything 
 since then to throw any light upon what became of him . " 

 " it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated , " said 
 holmes . 

 " oh , no , sir ! he was too good and kind to leave me so . why , all 
 the morning he was saying to me that , whatever happened , i was to 
 be true ; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to 
 separate us , i was always to remember that i was pledged to him , 
 and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later . it seemed 
 strange talk for a wedding - morning , but what has happened since 
 gives a meaning to it . " 

 " most certainly it does . your own opinion is , then , that some 
 unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him ? " 

 " yes , sir . i believe that he foresaw some danger , or else he 
 would not have talked so . and then i think that what he foresaw 
 happened . " 

 " but you have no notion as to what it could have been ? " 

 " none . " 

 " one more question . how did your mother take the matter ? " 

 " she was angry , and said that i was never to speak of the matter 
 again . " 

 " and your father ? did you tell him ? " 

 " yes ; and he seemed to think , with me , that something had 
 happened , and that i should hear of hosmer again . as he said , 
 what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of 
 the church , and then leaving me ? now , if he had borrowed my 
 money , or if he had married me and got my money settled on him , 
 there might be some reason , but hosmer was very independent about 
 money and never would look at a shilling of mine . and yet , what 
 could have happened ? and why could he not write ? oh , it drives me 
 half - mad to think of it , and i ca n't sleep a wink at night . " she 
 pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob 
 heavily into it . 

 " i shall glance into the case for you , " said holmes , rising , " and 
 i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result . let the 
 weight of the matter rest upon me now , and do not let your mind 
 dwell upon it further . above all , try to let mr. hosmer angel 
 vanish from your memory , as he has done from your life . " 

 " then you do n't think i 'll see him again ? " 

 " i fear not . " 

 " then what has happened to him ? " 

 " you will leave that question in my hands . i should like an 
 accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can 
 spare . " 

 " i advertised for him in last saturday 's chronicle , " said she . 
 " here is the slip and here are four letters from him . " 

 " thank you . and your address ? " 

 " no . 31 lyon place , camberwell . " 

 " mr. angel 's address you never had , i understand . where is your 
 father 's place of business ? " 

 " he travels for westhouse & marbank , the great claret importers 
 of fenchurch street . " 

 " thank you . you have made your statement very clearly . you will 
 leave the papers here , and remember the advice which i have given 
 you . let the whole incident be a sealed book , and do not allow it 
 to affect your life . " 

 " you are very kind , mr. holmes , but i can not do that . i shall be 
 true to hosmer . he shall find me ready when he comes back . " 

 for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face , there was 
 something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which 
 compelled our respect . she laid her little bundle of papers upon 
 the table and went her way , with a promise to come again whenever 
 she might be summoned . 

 sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips 
 still pressed together , his legs stretched out in front of him , 
 and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling . then he took down 
 from the rack the old and oily clay pipe , which was to him as a 
 counsellor , and , having lit it , he leaned back in his chair , with 
 the thick blue cloud - wreaths spinning up from him , and a look of 
 infinite languor in his face . 

 " quite an interesting study , that maiden , " he observed . " i found 
 her more interesting than her little problem , which , by the way , 
 is rather a trite one . you will find parallel cases , if you 
 consult my index , in andover in ' 77 , and there was something of 
 the sort at the hague last year . old as is the idea , however , 
 there were one or two details which were new to me . but the 
 maiden herself was most instructive . " 

 " you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite 
 invisible to me , " i remarked . 

 " not invisible but unnoticed , watson . you did not know where to 
 look , and so you missed all that was important . i can never bring 
 you to realise the importance of sleeves , the suggestiveness of 
 thumb - nails , or the great issues that may hang from a boot - lace . 
 now , what did you gather from that woman 's appearance ? describe 
 it . " 

 " well , she had a slate - coloured , broad - brimmed straw hat , with a 
 feather of a brickish red . her jacket was black , with black beads 
 sewn upon it , and a fringe of little black jet ornaments . her 
 dress was brown , rather darker than coffee colour , with a little 
 purple plush at the neck and sleeves . her gloves were greyish and 
 were worn through at the right forefinger . her boots i did n't 
 observe . she had small round , hanging gold earrings , and a 
 general air of being fairly well - to - do in a vulgar , comfortable , 
 easy - going way . " 

 sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled . 

 " ' pon my word , watson , you are coming along wonderfully . you have 
 really done very well indeed . it is true that you have missed 
 everything of importance , but you have hit upon the method , and 
 you have a quick eye for colour . never trust to general 
 impressions , my boy , but concentrate yourself upon details . my 
 first glance is always at a woman 's sleeve . in a man it is 
 perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser . as you 
 observe , this woman had plush upon her sleeves , which is a most 
 useful material for showing traces . the double line a little 
 above the wrist , where the typewritist presses against the table , 
 was beautifully defined . the sewing - machine , of the hand type , 
 leaves a similar mark , but only on the left arm , and on the side 
 of it farthest from the thumb , instead of being right across the 
 broadest part , as this was . i then glanced at her face , and , 
 observing the dint of a pince - nez at either side of her nose , i 
 ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting , which seemed 
 to surprise her . " 

 " it surprised me . " 

 " but , surely , it was obvious . i was then much surprised and 
 interested on glancing down to observe that , though the boots 
 which she was wearing were not unlike each other , they were 
 really odd ones ; the one having a slightly decorated toe - cap , and 
 the other a plain one . one was buttoned only in the two lower 
 buttons out of five , and the other at the first , third , and 
 fifth . now , when you see that a young lady , otherwise neatly 
 dressed , has come away from home with odd boots , half - buttoned , 
 it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry . " 

 " and what else ? " i asked , keenly interested , as i always was , by 
 my friend 's incisive reasoning . 

 " i noted , in passing , that she had written a note before leaving 
 home but after being fully dressed . you observed that her right 
 glove was torn at the forefinger , but you did not apparently see 
 that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink . she had 
 written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep . it must have been 
 this morning , or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger . 
 all this is amusing , though rather elementary , but i must go back 
 to business , watson . would you mind reading me the advertised 
 description of mr. hosmer angel ? " 

 i held the little printed slip to the light . 

 " missing , " it said , " on the morning of the fourteenth , a gentleman 
 named hosmer angel . about five ft . seven in . in height ; 
 strongly built , sallow complexion , black hair , a little bald in 
 the centre , bushy , black side - whiskers and moustache ; tinted 
 glasses , slight infirmity of speech . was dressed , when last seen , 
 in black frock - coat faced with silk , black waistcoat , gold albert 
 chain , and grey harris tweed trousers , with brown gaiters over 
 elastic - sided boots . known to have been employed in an office in 
 leadenhall street . anybody bringing-- " 

 " that will do , " said holmes . " as to the letters , " he continued , 
 glancing over them , " they are very commonplace . absolutely no 
 clue in them to mr. angel , save that he quotes balzac once . there 
 is one remarkable point , however , which will no doubt strike 
 you . " 

 " they are typewritten , " i remarked . 

 " not only that , but the signature is typewritten . look at the 
 neat little ' hosmer angel ' at the bottom . there is a date , you 
 see , but no superscription except leadenhall street , which is 
 rather vague . the point about the signature is very suggestive -- in 
 fact , we may call it conclusive . " 

 " of what ? " 

 " my dear fellow , is it possible you do not see how strongly it 
 bears upon the case ? " 

 " i can not say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able 
 to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were 
 instituted . " 

 " no , that was not the point . however , i shall write two letters , 
 which should settle the matter . one is to a firm in the city , the 
 other is to the young lady 's stepfather , mr. windibank , asking 
 him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow 
 evening . it is just as well that we should do business with the 
 male relatives . and now , doctor , we can do nothing until the 
 answers to those letters come , so we may put our little problem 
 upon the shelf for the interim . " 

 i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend 's subtle powers 
 of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that 
 he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy 
 demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had 
 been called upon to fathom . once only had i known him to fail , in 
 the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler 
 photograph ; but when i looked back to the weird business of the 
 sign of four , and the extraordinary circumstances connected with 
 the study in scarlet , i felt that it would be a strange tangle 
 indeed which he could not unravel . 

 i left him then , still puffing at his black clay pipe , with the 
 conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would 
 find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up 
 to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary 
 sutherland . 

 a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own 
 attention at the time , and the whole of next day i was busy at 
 the bedside of the sufferer . it was not until close upon six 
 o'clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a 
 hansom and drive to baker street , half afraid that i might be too 
 late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery . i found 
 sherlock holmes alone , however , half asleep , with his long , thin 
 form curled up in the recesses of his armchair . a formidable 
 array of bottles and test - tubes , with the pungent cleanly smell 
 of hydrochloric acid , told me that he had spent his day in the 
 chemical work which was so dear to him . 

 " well , have you solved it ? " i asked as i entered . 

 " yes . it was the bisulphate of baryta . " 

 " no , no , the mystery ! " i cried . 

 " oh , that ! i thought of the salt that i have been working upon . 
 there was never any mystery in the matter , though , as i said 
 yesterday , some of the details are of interest . the only drawback 
 is that there is no law , i fear , that can touch the scoundrel . " 

 " who was he , then , and what was his object in deserting miss 
 sutherland ? " 

 the question was hardly out of my mouth , and holmes had not yet 
 opened his lips to reply , when we heard a heavy footfall in the 
 passage and a tap at the door . 

 " this is the girl 's stepfather , mr. james windibank , " said 
 holmes . " he has written to me to say that he would be here at 
 six . come in ! " 

 the man who entered was a sturdy , middle - sized fellow , some 
 thirty years of age , clean - shaven , and sallow - skinned , with a 
 bland , insinuating manner , and a pair of wonderfully sharp and 
 penetrating grey eyes . he shot a questioning glance at each of 
 us , placed his shiny top - hat upon the sideboard , and with a 
 slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair . 

 " good - evening , mr. james windibank , " said holmes . " i think that 
 this typewritten letter is from you , in which you made an 
 appointment with me for six o'clock ? " 

 " yes , sir . i am afraid that i am a little late , but i am not 
 quite my own master , you know . i am sorry that miss sutherland 
 has troubled you about this little matter , for i think it is far 
 better not to wash linen of the sort in public . it was quite 
 against my wishes that she came , but she is a very excitable , 
 impulsive girl , as you may have noticed , and she is not easily 
 controlled when she has made up her mind on a point . of course , i 
 did not mind you so much , as you are not connected with the 
 official police , but it is not pleasant to have a family 
 misfortune like this noised abroad . besides , it is a useless 
 expense , for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel ? " 

 " on the contrary , " said holmes quietly ; " i have every reason to 
 believe that i will succeed in discovering mr. hosmer angel . " 

 mr. windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves . " i am 
 delighted to hear it , " he said . 

 " it is a curious thing , " remarked holmes , " that a typewriter has 
 really quite as much individuality as a man 's handwriting . unless 
 they are quite new , no two of them write exactly alike . some 
 letters get more worn than others , and some wear only on one 
 side . now , you remark in this note of yours , mr. windibank , that 
 in every case there is some little slurring over of the ' e , ' and 
 a slight defect in the tail of the ' r. ' there are fourteen other 
 characteristics , but those are the more obvious . " 

 " we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office , 
 and no doubt it is a little worn , " our visitor answered , glancing 
 keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes . 

 " and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study , 
 mr. windibank , " holmes continued . " i think of writing another 
 little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its 
 relation to crime . it is a subject to which i have devoted some 
 little attention . i have here four letters which purport to come 
 from the missing man . they are all typewritten . in each case , not 
 only are the ' e 's ' slurred and the ' r 's ' tailless , but you will 
 observe , if you care to use my magnifying lens , that the fourteen 
 other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well . " 

 mr. windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat . " i 
 can not waste time over this sort of fantastic talk , mr. holmes , " 
 he said . " if you can catch the man , catch him , and let me know 
 when you have done it . " 

 " certainly , " said holmes , stepping over and turning the key in 
 the door . " i let you know , then , that i have caught him ! " 

 " what ! where ? " shouted mr. windibank , turning white to his lips 
 and glancing about him like a rat in a trap . 

 " oh , it wo n't do -- really it wo n't , " said holmes suavely . " there 
 is no possible getting out of it , mr. windibank . it is quite too 
 transparent , and it was a very bad compliment when you said that 
 it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question . that 's 
 right ! sit down and let us talk it over . " 

 our visitor collapsed into a chair , with a ghastly face and a 
 glitter of moisture on his brow . " it -- it 's not actionable , " he 
 stammered . 

 " i am very much afraid that it is not . but between ourselves , 
 windibank , it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a 
 petty way as ever came before me . now , let me just run over the 
 course of events , and you will contradict me if i go wrong . " 

 the man sat huddled up in his chair , with his head sunk upon his 
 breast , like one who is utterly crushed . holmes stuck his feet up 
 on the corner of the mantelpiece and , leaning back with his hands 
 in his pockets , began talking , rather to himself , as it seemed , 
 than to us . 

 " the man married a woman very much older than himself for her 
 money , " said he , " and he enjoyed the use of the money of the 
 daughter as long as she lived with them . it was a considerable 
 sum , for people in their position , and the loss of it would have 
 made a serious difference . it was worth an effort to preserve it . 
 the daughter was of a good , amiable disposition , but affectionate 
 and warm - hearted in her ways , so that it was evident that with 
 her fair personal advantages , and her little income , she would 
 not be allowed to remain single long . now her marriage would 
 mean , of course , the loss of a hundred a year , so what does her 
 stepfather do to prevent it ? he takes the obvious course of 
 keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of 
 people of her own age . but soon he found that that would not 
 answer forever . she became restive , insisted upon her rights , and 
 finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain 
 ball . what does her clever stepfather do then ? he conceives an 
 idea more creditable to his head than to his heart . with the 
 connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself , 
 covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses , masked the face with 
 a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers , sunk that clear voice 
 into an insinuating whisper , and doubly secure on account of the 
 girl 's short sight , he appears as mr. hosmer angel , and keeps off 
 other lovers by making love himself . " 

 " it was only a joke at first , " groaned our visitor . " we never 
 thought that she would have been so carried away . " 

 " very likely not . however that may be , the young lady was very 
 decidedly carried away , and , having quite made up her mind that 
 her stepfather was in france , the suspicion of treachery never 
 for an instant entered her mind . she was flattered by the 
 gentleman 's attentions , and the effect was increased by the 
 loudly expressed admiration of her mother . then mr. angel began 
 to call , for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as 
 far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced . there 
 were meetings , and an engagement , which would finally secure the 
 girl 's affections from turning towards anyone else . but the 
 deception could not be kept up forever . these pretended journeys 
 to france were rather cumbrous . the thing to do was clearly to 
 bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it 
 would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady 's mind and 
 prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to 
 come . hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament , and 
 hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening 
 on the very morning of the wedding . james windibank wished miss 
 sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel , and so uncertain as to 
 his fate , that for ten years to come , at any rate , she would not 
 listen to another man . as far as the church door he brought her , 
 and then , as he could go no farther , he conveniently vanished 
 away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a 
 four - wheeler and out at the other . i think that was the chain of 
 events , mr. windibank ! " 

 our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes 
 had been talking , and he rose from his chair now with a cold 
 sneer upon his pale face . 

 " it may be so , or it may not , mr. holmes , " said he , " but if you 
 are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is 
 you who are breaking the law now , and not me . i have done nothing 
 actionable from the first , but as long as you keep that door 
 locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal 
 constraint . " 

 " the law can not , as you say , touch you , " said holmes , unlocking 
 and throwing open the door , " yet there never was a man who 
 deserved punishment more . if the young lady has a brother or a 
 friend , he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders . by jove ! " 
 he continued , flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon 
 the man 's face , " it is not part of my duties to my client , but 
 here 's a hunting crop handy , and i think i shall just treat 
 myself to-- " he took two swift steps to the whip , but before he 
 could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs , 
 the heavy hall door banged , and from the window we could see mr. 
 james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road . 

 " there 's a cold - blooded scoundrel ! " said holmes , laughing , as he 
 threw himself down into his chair once more . " that fellow will 
 rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad , and 
 ends on a gallows . the case has , in some respects , been not 
 entirely devoid of interest . " 

 " i can not now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning , " i 
 remarked . 

 " well , of course it was obvious from the first that this mr. 
 hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious 
 conduct , and it was equally clear that the only man who really 
 profited by the incident , as far as we could see , was the 
 stepfather . then the fact that the two men were never together , 
 but that the one always appeared when the other was away , was 
 suggestive . so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice , 
 which both hinted at a disguise , as did the bushy whiskers . my 
 suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in 
 typewriting his signature , which , of course , inferred that his 
 handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even 
 the smallest sample of it . you see all these isolated facts , 
 together with many minor ones , all pointed in the same 
 direction . " 

 " and how did you verify them ? " 

 " having once spotted my man , it was easy to get corroboration . i 
 knew the firm for which this man worked . having taken the printed 
 description . i eliminated everything from it which could be the 
 result of a disguise -- the whiskers , the glasses , the voice , and i 
 sent it to the firm , with a request that they would inform me 
 whether it answered to the description of any of their 
 travellers . i had already noticed the peculiarities of the 
 typewriter , and i wrote to the man himself at his business 
 address asking him if he would come here . as i expected , his 
 reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but 
 characteristic defects . the same post brought me a letter from 
 westhouse & marbank , of fenchurch street , to say that the 
 description tallied in every respect with that of their employé , 
 james windibank . voilà tout ! " 

 " and miss sutherland ? " 

 " if i tell her she will not believe me . you may remember the old 
 persian saying , ' there is danger for him who taketh the tiger 
 cub , and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman . ' 
 there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace , and as much 
 knowledge of the world . " 



 adventure iv . the boscombe valley mystery 

 we were seated at breakfast one morning , my wife and i , when the 
 maid brought in a telegram . it was from sherlock holmes and ran 
 in this way : 

 " have you a couple of days to spare ? have just been wired for from 
 the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy . 
 shall be glad if you will come with me . air and scenery perfect . 
 leave paddington by the 11:15 . " 

 " what do you say , dear ? " said my wife , looking across at me . 
 " will you go ? " 

 " i really do n't know what to say . i have a fairly long list at 
 present . " 

 " oh , anstruther would do your work for you . you have been looking 
 a little pale lately . i think that the change would do you good , 
 and you are always so interested in mr. sherlock holmes ' cases . " 

 " i should be ungrateful if i were not , seeing what i gained 
 through one of them , " i answered . " but if i am to go , i must pack 
 at once , for i have only half an hour . " 

 my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the 
 effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller . my wants were 
 few and simple , so that in less than the time stated i was in a 
 cab with my valise , rattling away to paddington station . sherlock 
 holmes was pacing up and down the platform , his tall , gaunt 
 figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey 
 travelling - cloak and close - fitting cloth cap . 

 " it is really very good of you to come , watson , " said he . " it 
 makes a considerable difference to me , having someone with me on 
 whom i can thoroughly rely . local aid is always either worthless 
 or else biassed . if you will keep the two corner seats i shall 
 get the tickets . " 

 we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of 
 papers which holmes had brought with him . among these he rummaged 
 and read , with intervals of note - taking and of meditation , until 
 we were past reading . then he suddenly rolled them all into a 
 gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack . 

 " have you heard anything of the case ? " he asked . 

 " not a word . i have not seen a paper for some days . " 

 " the london press has not had very full accounts . i have just 
 been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the 
 particulars . it seems , from what i gather , to be one of those 
 simple cases which are so extremely difficult . " 

 " that sounds a little paradoxical . " 

 " but it is profoundly true . singularity is almost invariably a 
 clue . the more featureless and commonplace a crime is , the more 
 difficult it is to bring it home . in this case , however , they 
 have established a very serious case against the son of the 
 murdered man . " 

 " it is a murder , then ? " 

 " well , it is conjectured to be so . i shall take nothing for 
 granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into 
 it . i will explain the state of things to you , as far as i have 
 been able to understand it , in a very few words . 

 " boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross , in 
 herefordshire . the largest landed proprietor in that part is a 
 mr. john turner , who made his money in australia and returned 
 some years ago to the old country . one of the farms which he 
 held , that of hatherley , was let to mr. charles mccarthy , who was 
 also an ex - australian . the men had known each other in the 
 colonies , so that it was not unnatural that when they came to 
 settle down they should do so as near each other as possible . 
 turner was apparently the richer man , so mccarthy became his 
 tenant but still remained , it seems , upon terms of perfect 
 equality , as they were frequently together . mccarthy had one son , 
 a lad of eighteen , and turner had an only daughter of the same 
 age , but neither of them had wives living . they appear to have 
 avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to 
 have led retired lives , though both the mccarthys were fond of 
 sport and were frequently seen at the race - meetings of the 
 neighbourhood . mccarthy kept two servants -- a man and a girl . 
 turner had a considerable household , some half - dozen at the 
 least . that is as much as i have been able to gather about the 
 families . now for the facts . 

 " on june 3rd , that is , on monday last , mccarthy left his house at 
 hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the 
 boscombe pool , which is a small lake formed by the spreading out 
 of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley . he had been 
 out with his serving - man in the morning at ross , and he had told 
 the man that he must hurry , as he had an appointment of 
 importance to keep at three . from that appointment he never came 
 back alive . 

 " from hatherley farm - house to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a 
 mile , and two people saw him as he passed over this ground . one 
 was an old woman , whose name is not mentioned , and the other was 
 william crowder , a game - keeper in the employ of mr. turner . both 
 these witnesses depose that mr. mccarthy was walking alone . the 
 game - keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr. 
 mccarthy pass he had seen his son , mr. james mccarthy , going the 
 same way with a gun under his arm . to the best of his belief , the 
 father was actually in sight at the time , and the son was 
 following him . he thought no more of the matter until he heard in 
 the evening of the tragedy that had occurred . 

 " the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder , 
 the game - keeper , lost sight of them . the boscombe pool is thickly 
 wooded round , with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the 
 edge . a girl of fourteen , patience moran , who is the daughter of 
 the lodge - keeper of the boscombe valley estate , was in one of the 
 woods picking flowers . she states that while she was there she 
 saw , at the border of the wood and close by the lake , mr. 
 mccarthy and his son , and that they appeared to be having a 
 violent quarrel . she heard mr. mccarthy the elder using very 
 strong language to his son , and she saw the latter raise up his 
 hand as if to strike his father . she was so frightened by their 
 violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached 
 home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near 
 boscombe pool , and that she was afraid that they were going to 
 fight . she had hardly said the words when young mr. mccarthy came 
 running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead 
 in the wood , and to ask for the help of the lodge - keeper . he was 
 much excited , without either his gun or his hat , and his right 
 hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood . on 
 following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the 
 grass beside the pool . the head had been beaten in by repeated 
 blows of some heavy and blunt weapon . the injuries were such as 
 might very well have been inflicted by the butt - end of his son 's 
 gun , which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the 
 body . under these circumstances the young man was instantly 
 arrested , and a verdict of ' wilful murder ' having been returned 
 at the inquest on tuesday , he was on wednesday brought before the 
 magistrates at ross , who have referred the case to the next 
 assizes . those are the main facts of the case as they came out 
 before the coroner and the police - court . " 

 " i could hardly imagine a more damning case , " i remarked . " if 
 ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so 
 here . " 

 " circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing , " answered holmes 
 thoughtfully . " it may seem to point very straight to one thing , 
 but if you shift your own point of view a little , you may find it 
 pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something 
 entirely different . it must be confessed , however , that the case 
 looks exceedingly grave against the young man , and it is very 
 possible that he is indeed the culprit . there are several people 
 in the neighbourhood , however , and among them miss turner , the 
 daughter of the neighbouring landowner , who believe in his 
 innocence , and who have retained lestrade , whom you may recollect 
 in connection with the study in scarlet , to work out the case in 
 his interest . lestrade , being rather puzzled , has referred the 
 case to me , and hence it is that two middle - aged gentlemen are 
 flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly 
 digesting their breakfasts at home . " 

 " i am afraid , " said i , " that the facts are so obvious that you 
 will find little credit to be gained out of this case . " 

 " there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact , " he 
 answered , laughing . " besides , we may chance to hit upon some 
 other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to 
 mr. lestrade . you know me too well to think that i am boasting 
 when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by 
 means which he is quite incapable of employing , or even of 
 understanding . to take the first example to hand , i very clearly 
 perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right - hand 
 side , and yet i question whether mr. lestrade would have noted 
 even so self - evident a thing as that . " 

 " how on earth-- " 

 " my dear fellow , i know you well . i know the military neatness 
 which characterises you . you shave every morning , and in this 
 season you shave by the sunlight ; but since your shaving is less 
 and less complete as we get farther back on the left side , until 
 it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the 
 jaw , it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated 
 than the other . i could not imagine a man of your habits looking 
 at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a 
 result . i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and 
 inference . therein lies my métier , and it is just possible that 
 it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before 
 us . there are one or two minor points which were brought out in 
 the inquest , and which are worth considering . " 

 " what are they ? " 

 " it appears that his arrest did not take place at once , but after 
 the return to hatherley farm . on the inspector of constabulary 
 informing him that he was a prisoner , he remarked that he was not 
 surprised to hear it , and that it was no more than his deserts . 
 this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any 
 traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the 
 coroner 's jury . " 

 " it was a confession , " i ejaculated . 

 " no , for it was followed by a protestation of innocence . " 

 " coming on the top of such a damning series of events , it was at 
 least a most suspicious remark . " 

 " on the contrary , " said holmes , " it is the brightest rift which i 
 can at present see in the clouds . however innocent he might be , 
 he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the 
 circumstances were very black against him . had he appeared 
 surprised at his own arrest , or feigned indignation at it , i 
 should have looked upon it as highly suspicious , because such 
 surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances , 
 and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man . his 
 frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent 
 man , or else as a man of considerable self - restraint and 
 firmness . as to his remark about his deserts , it was also not 
 unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of 
 his father , and that there is no doubt that he had that very day 
 so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him , and 
 even , according to the little girl whose evidence is so 
 important , to raise his hand as if to strike him . the 
 self - reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark 
 appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a 
 guilty one . " 

 i shook my head . " many men have been hanged on far slighter 
 evidence , " i remarked . 

 " so they have . and many men have been wrongfully hanged . " 

 " what is the young man 's own account of the matter ? " 

 " it is , i am afraid , not very encouraging to his supporters , 
 though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive . 
 you will find it here , and may read it for yourself . " 

 he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire 
 paper , and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the 
 paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own 
 statement of what had occurred . i settled myself down in the 
 corner of the carriage and read it very carefully . it ran in this 
 way : 

 " mr. james mccarthy , the only son of the deceased , was then called 
 and gave evidence as follows : ' i had been away from home for 
 three days at bristol , and had only just returned upon the 
 morning of last monday , the 3rd . my father was absent from home at 
 the time of my arrival , and i was informed by the maid that he 
 had driven over to ross with john cobb , the groom . shortly after 
 my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard , and , 
 looking out of my window , i saw him get out and walk rapidly out 
 of the yard , though i was not aware in which direction he was 
 going . i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of 
 the boscombe pool , with the intention of visiting the rabbit 
 warren which is upon the other side . on my way i saw william 
 crowder , the game - keeper , as he had stated in his evidence ; but 
 he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father . i had 
 no idea that he was in front of me . when about a hundred yards 
 from the pool i heard a cry of " cooee ! " which was a usual signal 
 between my father and myself . i then hurried forward , and found 
 him standing by the pool . he appeared to be much surprised at 
 seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there . a 
 conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows , 
 for my father was a man of a very violent temper . seeing that his 
 passion was becoming ungovernable , i left him and returned 
 towards hatherley farm . i had not gone more than 150 yards , 
 however , when i heard a hideous outcry behind me , which caused me 
 to run back again . i found my father expiring upon the ground , 
 with his head terribly injured . i dropped my gun and held him in 
 my arms , but he almost instantly expired . i knelt beside him for 
 some minutes , and then made my way to mr. turner 's lodge - keeper , 
 his house being the nearest , to ask for assistance . i saw no one 
 near my father when i returned , and i have no idea how he came by 
 his injuries . he was not a popular man , being somewhat cold and 
 forbidding in his manners , but he had , as far as i know , no 
 active enemies . i know nothing further of the matter . ' 

 " the coroner : did your father make any statement to you before 
 he died ? 

 " witness : he mumbled a few words , but i could only catch some 
 allusion to a rat . 

 " the coroner : what did you understand by that ? 

 " witness : it conveyed no meaning to me . i thought that he was 
 delirious . 

 " the coroner : what was the point upon which you and your father 
 had this final quarrel ? 

 " witness : i should prefer not to answer . 

 " the coroner : i am afraid that i must press it . 

 " witness : it is really impossible for me to tell you . i can 
 assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which 
 followed . 

 " the coroner : that is for the court to decide . i need not point 
 out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case 
 considerably in any future proceedings which may arise . 

 " witness : i must still refuse . 

 " the coroner : i understand that the cry of ' cooee ' was a common 
 signal between you and your father ? 

 " witness : it was . 

 " the coroner : how was it , then , that he uttered it before he saw 
 you , and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol ? 

 " witness ( with considerable confusion ) : i do not know . 

 " a juryman : did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions 
 when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father 
 fatally injured ? 

 " witness : nothing definite . 

 " the coroner : what do you mean ? 

 " witness : i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into 
 the open , that i could think of nothing except of my father . yet 
 i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay 
 upon the ground to the left of me . it seemed to me to be 
 something grey in colour , a coat of some sort , or a plaid perhaps . 
 when i rose from my father i looked round for it , but it was 
 gone . 

 " ' do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help ? ' 

 " ' yes , it was gone . ' 

 " ' you can not say what it was ? ' 

 " ' no , i had a feeling something was there . ' 

 " ' how far from the body ? ' 

 " ' a dozen yards or so . ' 

 " ' and how far from the edge of the wood ? ' 

 " ' about the same . ' 

 " ' then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen 
 yards of it ? ' 

 " ' yes , but with my back towards it . ' 

 " this concluded the examination of the witness . " 

 " i see , " said i as i glanced down the column , " that the coroner 
 in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy . 
 he calls attention , and with reason , to the discrepancy about his 
 father having signalled to him before seeing him , also to his 
 refusal to give details of his conversation with his father , and 
 his singular account of his father 's dying words . they are all , 
 as he remarks , very much against the son . " 

 holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon 
 the cushioned seat . " both you and the coroner have been at some 
 pains , " said he , " to single out the very strongest points in the 
 young man 's favour . do n't you see that you alternately give him 
 credit for having too much imagination and too little ? too 
 little , if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would 
 give him the sympathy of the jury ; too much , if he evolved from 
 his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying 
 reference to a rat , and the incident of the vanishing cloth . no , 
 sir , i shall approach this case from the point of view that what 
 this young man says is true , and we shall see whither that 
 hypothesis will lead us . and now here is my pocket petrarch , and 
 not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the 
 scene of action . we lunch at swindon , and i see that we shall be 
 there in twenty minutes . " 

 it was nearly four o'clock when we at last , after passing through 
 the beautiful stroud valley , and over the broad gleaming severn , 
 found ourselves at the pretty little country - town of ross . a 
 lean , ferret - like man , furtive and sly - looking , was waiting for 
 us upon the platform . in spite of the light brown dustcoat and 
 leather - leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic 
 surroundings , i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade , of 
 scotland yard . with him we drove to the hereford arms where a 
 room had already been engaged for us . 

 " i have ordered a carriage , " said lestrade as we sat over a cup 
 of tea . " i knew your energetic nature , and that you would not be 
 happy until you had been on the scene of the crime . " 

 " it was very nice and complimentary of you , " holmes answered . " it 
 is entirely a question of barometric pressure . " 

 lestrade looked startled . " i do not quite follow , " he said . 

 " how is the glass ? twenty - nine , i see . no wind , and not a cloud 
 in the sky . i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need 
 smoking , and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country 
 hotel abomination . i do not think that it is probable that i 
 shall use the carriage to - night . " 

 lestrade laughed indulgently . " you have , no doubt , already formed 
 your conclusions from the newspapers , " he said . " the case is as 
 plain as a pikestaff , and the more one goes into it the plainer 
 it becomes . still , of course , one ca n't refuse a lady , and such a 
 very positive one , too . she has heard of you , and would have your 
 opinion , though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing 
 which you could do which i had not already done . why , bless my 
 soul ! here is her carriage at the door . " 

 he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the 
 most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life . her 
 violet eyes shining , her lips parted , a pink flush upon her 
 cheeks , all thought of her natural reserve lost in her 
 overpowering excitement and concern . 

 " oh , mr. sherlock holmes ! " she cried , glancing from one to the 
 other of us , and finally , with a woman 's quick intuition , 
 fastening upon my companion , " i am so glad that you have come . i 
 have driven down to tell you so . i know that james did n't do it . 
 i know it , and i want you to start upon your work knowing it , 
 too . never let yourself doubt upon that point . we have known each 
 other since we were little children , and i know his faults as no 
 one else does ; but he is too tender - hearted to hurt a fly . such a 
 charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him . " 

 " i hope we may clear him , miss turner , " said sherlock holmes . 
 " you may rely upon my doing all that i can . " 

 " but you have read the evidence . you have formed some conclusion ? 
 do you not see some loophole , some flaw ? do you not yourself 
 think that he is innocent ? " 

 " i think that it is very probable . " 

 " there , now ! " she cried , throwing back her head and looking 
 defiantly at lestrade . " you hear ! he gives me hopes . " 

 lestrade shrugged his shoulders . " i am afraid that my colleague 
 has been a little quick in forming his conclusions , " he said . 

 " but he is right . oh ! i know that he is right . james never did 
 it . and about his quarrel with his father , i am sure that the 
 reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because 
 i was concerned in it . " 

 " in what way ? " asked holmes . 

 " it is no time for me to hide anything . james and his father had 
 many disagreements about me . mr. mccarthy was very anxious that 
 there should be a marriage between us . james and i have always 
 loved each other as brother and sister ; but of course he is young 
 and has seen very little of life yet , and -- and -- well , he 
 naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet . so there 
 were quarrels , and this , i am sure , was one of them . " 

 " and your father ? " asked holmes . " was he in favour of such a 
 union ? " 

 " no , he was averse to it also . no one but mr. mccarthy was in 
 favour of it . " a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as 
 holmes shot one of his keen , questioning glances at her . 

 " thank you for this information , " said he . " may i see your father 
 if i call to - morrow ? " 

 " i am afraid the doctor wo n't allow it . " 

 " the doctor ? " 

 " yes , have you not heard ? poor father has never been strong for 
 years back , but this has broken him down completely . he has taken 
 to his bed , and dr. willows says that he is a wreck and that his 
 nervous system is shattered . mr. mccarthy was the only man alive 
 who had known dad in the old days in victoria . " 

 " ha ! in victoria ! that is important . " 

 " yes , at the mines . " 

 " quite so ; at the gold - mines , where , as i understand , mr. turner 
 made his money . " 

 " yes , certainly . " 

 " thank you , miss turner . you have been of material assistance to 
 me . " 

 " you will tell me if you have any news to - morrow . no doubt you 
 will go to the prison to see james . oh , if you do , mr. holmes , do 
 tell him that i know him to be innocent . " 

 " i will , miss turner . " 

 " i must go home now , for dad is very ill , and he misses me so if 
 i leave him . good - bye , and god help you in your undertaking . " she 
 hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered , and we 
 heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street . 

 " i am ashamed of you , holmes , " said lestrade with dignity after a 
 few minutes ' silence . " why should you raise up hopes which you 
 are bound to disappoint ? i am not over - tender of heart , but i 
 call it cruel . " 

 " i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy , " said 
 holmes . " have you an order to see him in prison ? " 

 " yes , but only for you and me . " 

 " then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out . we have 
 still time to take a train to hereford and see him to - night ? " 

 " ample . " 

 " then let us do so . watson , i fear that you will find it very 
 slow , but i shall only be away a couple of hours . " 

 i walked down to the station with them , and then wandered through 
 the streets of the little town , finally returning to the hotel , 
 where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a 
 yellow - backed novel . the puny plot of the story was so thin , 
 however , when compared to the deep mystery through which we were 
 groping , and i found my attention wander so continually from the 
 action to the fact , that i at last flung it across the room and 
 gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the 
 day . supposing that this unhappy young man 's story were 
 absolutely true , then what hellish thing , what absolutely 
 unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between 
 the time when he parted from his father , and the moment when , 
 drawn back by his screams , he rushed into the glade ? it was 
 something terrible and deadly . what could it be ? might not the 
 nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts ? 
 i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper , which 
 contained a verbatim account of the inquest . in the surgeon 's 
 deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left 
 parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been 
 shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon . i marked the spot 
 upon my own head . clearly such a blow must have been struck from 
 behind . that was to some extent in favour of the accused , as when 
 seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father . still , it 
 did not go for very much , for the older man might have turned his 
 back before the blow fell . still , it might be worth while to call 
 holmes ' attention to it . then there was the peculiar dying 
 reference to a rat . what could that mean ? it could not be 
 delirium . a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become 
 delirious . no , it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how 
 he met his fate . but what could it indicate ? i cudgelled my 
 brains to find some possible explanation . and then the incident 
 of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy . if that were true the 
 murderer must have dropped some part of his dress , presumably his 
 overcoat , in his flight , and must have had the hardihood to 
 return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was 
 kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off . what a 
 tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was ! i 
 did not wonder at lestrade 's opinion , and yet i had so much faith 
 in sherlock holmes ' insight that i could not lose hope as long 
 as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young 
 mccarthy 's innocence . 

 it was late before sherlock holmes returned . he came back alone , 
 for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town . 

 " the glass still keeps very high , " he remarked as he sat down . 
 " it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able 
 to go over the ground . on the other hand , a man should be at his 
 very best and keenest for such nice work as that , and i did not 
 wish to do it when fagged by a long journey . i have seen young 
 mccarthy . " 

 " and what did you learn from him ? " 

 " nothing . " 

 " could he throw no light ? " 

 " none at all . i was inclined to think at one time that he knew 
 who had done it and was screening him or her , but i am convinced 
 now that he is as puzzled as everyone else . he is not a very 
 quick - witted youth , though comely to look at and , i should think , 
 sound at heart . " 

 " i can not admire his taste , " i remarked , " if it is indeed a fact 
 that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as 
 this miss turner . " 

 " ah , thereby hangs a rather painful tale . this fellow is madly , 
 insanely , in love with her , but some two years ago , when he was 
 only a lad , and before he really knew her , for she had been away 
 five years at a boarding - school , what does the idiot do but get 
 into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a 
 registry office ? no one knows a word of the matter , but you can 
 imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not 
 doing what he would give his very eyes to do , but what he knows 
 to be absolutely impossible . it was sheer frenzy of this sort 
 which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father , 
 at their last interview , was goading him on to propose to miss 
 turner . on the other hand , he had no means of supporting himself , 
 and his father , who was by all accounts a very hard man , would 
 have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth . it was with 
 his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in 
 bristol , and his father did not know where he was . mark that 
 point . it is of importance . good has come out of evil , however , 
 for the barmaid , finding from the papers that he is in serious 
 trouble and likely to be hanged , has thrown him over utterly and 
 has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the 
 bermuda dockyard , so that there is really no tie between them . i 
 think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all 
 that he has suffered . " 

 " but if he is innocent , who has done it ? " 

 " ah ! who ? i would call your attention very particularly to two 
 points . one is that the murdered man had an appointment with 
 someone at the pool , and that the someone could not have been his 
 son , for his son was away , and he did not know when he would 
 return . the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 
 ' cooee ! ' before he knew that his son had returned . those are the 
 crucial points upon which the case depends . and now let us talk 
 about george meredith , if you please , and we shall leave all 
 minor matters until to - morrow . " 

 there was no rain , as holmes had foretold , and the morning broke 
 bright and cloudless . at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with 
 the carriage , and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe 
 pool . 

 " there is serious news this morning , " lestrade observed . " it is 
 said that mr. turner , of the hall , is so ill that his life is 
 despaired of . " 

 " an elderly man , i presume ? " said holmes . 

 " about sixty ; but his constitution has been shattered by his life 
 abroad , and he has been in failing health for some time . this 
 business has had a very bad effect upon him . he was an old friend 
 of mccarthy 's , and , i may add , a great benefactor to him , for i 
 have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free . " 

 " indeed ! that is interesting , " said holmes . 

 " oh , yes ! in a hundred other ways he has helped him . everybody 
 about here speaks of his kindness to him . " 

 " really ! does it not strike you as a little singular that this 
 mccarthy , who appears to have had little of his own , and to have 
 been under such obligations to turner , should still talk of 
 marrying his son to turner 's daughter , who is , presumably , 
 heiress to the estate , and that in such a very cocksure manner , 
 as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would 
 follow ? it is the more strange , since we know that turner himself 
 was averse to the idea . the daughter told us as much . do you not 
 deduce something from that ? " 

 " we have got to the deductions and the inferences , " said 
 lestrade , winking at me . " i find it hard enough to tackle facts , 
 holmes , without flying away after theories and fancies . " 

 " you are right , " said holmes demurely ; " you do find it very hard 
 to tackle the facts . " 

 " anyhow , i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it 
 difficult to get hold of , " replied lestrade with some warmth . 

 " and that is-- " 

 " that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that 
 all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine . " 

 " well , moonshine is a brighter thing than fog , " said holmes , 
 laughing . " but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley 
 farm upon the left . " 

 " yes , that is it . " it was a widespread , comfortable - looking 
 building , two - storied , slate - roofed , with great yellow blotches 
 of lichen upon the grey walls . the drawn blinds and the smokeless 
 chimneys , however , gave it a stricken look , as though the weight 
 of this horror still lay heavy upon it . we called at the door , 
 when the maid , at holmes ' request , showed us the boots which her 
 master wore at the time of his death , and also a pair of the 
 son 's , though not the pair which he had then had . having measured 
 these very carefully from seven or eight different points , holmes 
 desired to be led to the court - yard , from which we all followed 
 the winding track which led to boscombe pool . 

 sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent 
 as this . men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of 
 baker street would have failed to recognise him . his face flushed 
 and darkened . his brows were drawn into two hard black lines , 
 while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter . 
 his face was bent downward , his shoulders bowed , his lips 
 compressed , and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long , 
 sinewy neck . his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal 
 lust for the chase , and his mind was so absolutely concentrated 
 upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell 
 unheeded upon his ears , or , at the most , only provoked a quick , 
 impatient snarl in reply . swiftly and silently he made his way 
 along the track which ran through the meadows , and so by way of 
 the woods to the boscombe pool . it was damp , marshy ground , as is 
 all that district , and there were marks of many feet , both upon 
 the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either 
 side . sometimes holmes would hurry on , sometimes stop dead , and 
 once he made quite a little detour into the meadow . lestrade and 
 i walked behind him , the detective indifferent and contemptuous , 
 while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the 
 conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a 
 definite end . 

 the boscombe pool , which is a little reed - girt sheet of water 
 some fifty yards across , is situated at the boundary between the 
 hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner . 
 above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see 
 the red , jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich 
 landowner 's dwelling . on the hatherley side of the pool the woods 
 grew very thick , and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass 
 twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds 
 which lined the lake . lestrade showed us the exact spot at which 
 the body had been found , and , indeed , so moist was the ground , 
 that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the 
 fall of the stricken man . to holmes , as i could see by his eager 
 face and peering eyes , very many other things were to be read 
 upon the trampled grass . he ran round , like a dog who is picking 
 up a scent , and then turned upon my companion . 

 " what did you go into the pool for ? " he asked . 

 " i fished about with a rake . i thought there might be some weapon 
 or other trace . but how on earth-- " 

 " oh , tut , tut ! i have no time ! that left foot of yours with its 
 inward twist is all over the place . a mole could trace it , and 
 there it vanishes among the reeds . oh , how simple it would all 
 have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo 
 and wallowed all over it . here is where the party with the 
 lodge - keeper came , and they have covered all tracks for six or 
 eight feet round the body . but here are three separate tracks of 
 the same feet . " he drew out a lens and lay down upon his 
 waterproof to have a better view , talking all the time rather to 
 himself than to us . " these are young mccarthy 's feet . twice he 
 was walking , and once he ran swiftly , so that the soles are 
 deeply marked and the heels hardly visible . that bears out his 
 story . he ran when he saw his father on the ground . then here are 
 the father 's feet as he paced up and down . what is this , then ? it 
 is the butt - end of the gun as the son stood listening . and this ? 
 ha , ha ! what have we here ? tiptoes ! tiptoes ! square , too , quite 
 unusual boots ! they come , they go , they come again -- of course 
 that was for the cloak . now where did they come from ? " he ran up 
 and down , sometimes losing , sometimes finding the track until we 
 were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a 
 great beech , the largest tree in the neighbourhood . holmes traced 
 his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon 
 his face with a little cry of satisfaction . for a long time he 
 remained there , turning over the leaves and dried sticks , 
 gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and 
 examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of 
 the tree as far as he could reach . a jagged stone was lying among 
 the moss , and this also he carefully examined and retained . then 
 he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the 
 highroad , where all traces were lost . 

 " it has been a case of considerable interest , " he remarked , 
 returning to his natural manner . " i fancy that this grey house on 
 the right must be the lodge . i think that i will go in and have a 
 word with moran , and perhaps write a little note . having done 
 that , we may drive back to our luncheon . you may walk to the cab , 
 and i shall be with you presently . " 

 it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove 
 back into ross , holmes still carrying with him the stone which he 
 had picked up in the wood . 

 " this may interest you , lestrade , " he remarked , holding it out . 
 " the murder was done with it . " 

 " i see no marks . " 

 " there are none . " 

 " how do you know , then ? " 

 " the grass was growing under it . it had only lain there a few 
 days . there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken . it 
 corresponds with the injuries . there is no sign of any other 
 weapon . " 

 " and the murderer ? " 

 " is a tall man , left - handed , limps with the right leg , wears 
 thick - soled shooting - boots and a grey cloak , smokes indian 
 cigars , uses a cigar - holder , and carries a blunt pen - knife in his 
 pocket . there are several other indications , but these may be 
 enough to aid us in our search . " 

 lestrade laughed . " i am afraid that i am still a sceptic , " he 
 said . " theories are all very well , but we have to deal with a 
 hard - headed british jury . " 

 " nous verrons , " answered holmes calmly . " you work your own 
 method , and i shall work mine . i shall be busy this afternoon , 
 and shall probably return to london by the evening train . " 

 " and leave your case unfinished ? " 

 " no , finished . " 

 " but the mystery ? " 

 " it is solved . " 

 " who was the criminal , then ? " 

 " the gentleman i describe . " 

 " but who is he ? " 

 " surely it would not be difficult to find out . this is not such a 
 populous neighbourhood . " 

 lestrade shrugged his shoulders . " i am a practical man , " he said , 
 " and i really can not undertake to go about the country looking 
 for a left - handed gentleman with a game leg . i should become the 
 laughing - stock of scotland yard . " 

 " all right , " said holmes quietly . " i have given you the chance . 
 here are your lodgings . good - bye . i shall drop you a line before 
 i leave . " 

 having left lestrade at his rooms , we drove to our hotel , where 
 we found lunch upon the table . holmes was silent and buried in 
 thought with a pained expression upon his face , as one who finds 
 himself in a perplexing position . 

 " look here , watson , " he said when the cloth was cleared " just sit 
 down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little . i do n't 
 know quite what to do , and i should value your advice . light a 
 cigar and let me expound . " 

  " pray do so . " 

 " well , now , in considering this case there are two points about 
 young mccarthy 's narrative which struck us both instantly , 
 although they impressed me in his favour and you against him . one 
 was the fact that his father should , according to his account , 
 cry ' cooee ! ' before seeing him . the other was his singular dying 
 reference to a rat . he mumbled several words , you understand , but 
 that was all that caught the son 's ear . now from this double 
 point our research must commence , and we will begin it by 
 presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true . " 

 " what of this ' cooee ! ' then ? " 

 " well , obviously it could not have been meant for the son . the 
 son , as far as he knew , was in bristol . it was mere chance that 
 he was within earshot . the ' cooee ! ' was meant to attract the 
 attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with . but 
 ' cooee ' is a distinctly australian cry , and one which is used 
 between australians . there is a strong presumption that the 
 person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was 
 someone who had been in australia . " 

 " what of the rat , then ? " 

 sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened 
 it out on the table . " this is a map of the colony of victoria , " 
 he said . " i wired to bristol for it last night . " he put his hand 
 over part of the map . " what do you read ? " 

 " arat , " i read . 

 " and now ? " he raised his hand . 

 " ballarat . " 

 " quite so . that was the word the man uttered , and of which his 
 son only caught the last two syllables . he was trying to utter 
 the name of his murderer . so and so , of ballarat . " 

 " it is wonderful ! " i exclaimed . 

 " it is obvious . and now , you see , i had narrowed the field down 
 considerably . the possession of a grey garment was a third point 
 which , granting the son 's statement to be correct , was a 
 certainty . we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite 
 conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak . " 

 " certainly . " 

 " and one who was at home in the district , for the pool can only 
 be approached by the farm or by the estate , where strangers could 
 hardly wander . " 

 " quite so . " 

 " then comes our expedition of to - day . by an examination of the 
 ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that 
 imbecile lestrade , as to the personality of the criminal . " 

 " but how did you gain them ? " 

 " you know my method . it is founded upon the observation of 
 trifles . " 

 " his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length 
 of his stride . his boots , too , might be told from their traces . " 

 " yes , they were peculiar boots . " 

 " but his lameness ? " 

 " the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than 
 his left . he put less weight upon it . why ? because he limped -- he 
 was lame . " 

 " but his left - handedness . " 

 " you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded 
 by the surgeon at the inquest . the blow was struck from 
 immediately behind , and yet was upon the left side . now , how can 
 that be unless it were by a left - handed man ? he had stood behind 
 that tree during the interview between the father and son . he had 
 even smoked there . i found the ash of a cigar , which my special 
 knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian 
 cigar . i have , as you know , devoted some attention to this , and 
 written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different 
 varieties of pipe , cigar , and cigarette tobacco . having found the 
 ash , i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss 
 where he had tossed it . it was an indian cigar , of the variety 
 which are rolled in rotterdam . " 

 " and the cigar - holder ? " 

 " i could see that the end had not been in his mouth . therefore he 
 used a holder . the tip had been cut off , not bitten off , but the 
 cut was not a clean one , so i deduced a blunt pen - knife . " 

 " holmes , " i said , " you have drawn a net round this man from which 
 he can not escape , and you have saved an innocent human life as 
 truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him . i see the 
 direction in which all this points . the culprit is-- " 

 " mr. john turner , " cried the hotel waiter , opening the door of 
 our sitting - room , and ushering in a visitor . 

 the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure . his 
 slow , limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of 
 decrepitude , and yet his hard , deep - lined , craggy features , and 
 his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual 
 strength of body and of character . his tangled beard , grizzled 
 hair , and outstanding , drooping eyebrows combined to give an air 
 of dignity and power to his appearance , but his face was of an 
 ashen white , while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were 
 tinged with a shade of blue . it was clear to me at a glance that 
 he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease . 

 " pray sit down on the sofa , " said holmes gently . " you had my 
 note ? " 

 " yes , the lodge - keeper brought it up . you said that you wished to 
 see me here to avoid scandal . " 

 " i thought people would talk if i went to the hall . " 

 " and why did you wish to see me ? " he looked across at my 
 companion with despair in his weary eyes , as though his question 
 was already answered . 

 " yes , " said holmes , answering the look rather than the words . " it 
 is so . i know all about mccarthy . " 

 the old man sank his face in his hands . " god help me ! " he cried . 
 " but i would not have let the young man come to harm . i give you 
 my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at 
 the assizes . " 

 " i am glad to hear you say so , " said holmes gravely . 

 " i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl . it 
 would break her heart -- it will break her heart when she hears 
 that i am arrested . " 

 " it may not come to that , " said holmes . 

 " what ? " 

 " i am no official agent . i understand that it was your daughter 
 who required my presence here , and i am acting in her interests . 
 young mccarthy must be got off , however . " 

 " i am a dying man , " said old turner . " i have had diabetes for 
 years . my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a 
 month . yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol . " 

 holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand 
 and a bundle of paper before him . " just tell us the truth , " he 
 said . " i shall jot down the facts . you will sign it , and watson 
 here can witness it . then i could produce your confession at the 
 last extremity to save young mccarthy . i promise you that i shall 
 not use it unless it is absolutely needed . " 

 " it 's as well , " said the old man ; " it 's a question whether i 
 shall live to the assizes , so it matters little to me , but i 
 should wish to spare alice the shock . and now i will make the 
 thing clear to you ; it has been a long time in the acting , but 
 will not take me long to tell . 

 " you did n't know this dead man , mccarthy . he was a devil 
 incarnate . i tell you that . god keep you out of the clutches of 
 such a man as he . his grip has been upon me these twenty years , 
 and he has blasted my life . i 'll tell you first how i came to be 
 in his power . 

 " it was in the early ' 60 's at the diggings . i was a young chap 
 then , hot - blooded and reckless , ready to turn my hand at 
 anything ; i got among bad companions , took to drink , had no luck 
 with my claim , took to the bush , and in a word became what you 
 would call over here a highway robber . there were six of us , and 
 we had a wild , free life of it , sticking up a station from time 
 to time , or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings . 
 black jack of ballarat was the name i went under , and our party 
 is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang . 

 " one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne , and 
 we lay in wait for it and attacked it . there were six troopers 
 and six of us , so it was a close thing , but we emptied four of 
 their saddles at the first volley . three of our boys were killed , 
 however , before we got the swag . i put my pistol to the head of 
 the wagon - driver , who was this very man mccarthy . i wish to the 
 lord that i had shot him then , but i spared him , though i saw his 
 wicked little eyes fixed on my face , as though to remember every 
 feature . we got away with the gold , became wealthy men , and made 
 our way over to england without being suspected . there i parted 
 from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and 
 respectable life . i bought this estate , which chanced to be in 
 the market , and i set myself to do a little good with my money , 
 to make up for the way in which i had earned it . i married , too , 
 and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice . 
 even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down 
 the right path as nothing else had ever done . in a word , i turned 
 over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past . all was 
 going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me . 

 " i had gone up to town about an investment , and i met him in 
 regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his 
 foot . 

 " ' here we are , jack , ' says he , touching me on the arm ; ' we 'll be 
 as good as a family to you . there 's two of us , me and my son , and 
 you can have the keeping of us . if you don't -- it 's a fine , 
 law - abiding country is england , and there 's always a policeman 
 within hail . ' 

 " well , down they came to the west country , there was no shaking 
 them off , and there they have lived rent free on my best land 
 ever since . there was no rest for me , no peace , no forgetfulness ; 
 turn where i would , there was his cunning , grinning face at my 
 elbow . it grew worse as alice grew up , for he soon saw i was more 
 afraid of her knowing my past than of the police . whatever he 
 wanted he must have , and whatever it was i gave him without 
 question , land , money , houses , until at last he asked a thing 
 which i could not give . he asked for alice . 

 " his son , you see , had grown up , and so had my girl , and as i was 
 known to be in weak health , it seemed a fine stroke to him that 
 his lad should step into the whole property . but there i was 
 firm . i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine ; not that 
 i had any dislike to the lad , but his blood was in him , and that 
 was enough . i stood firm . mccarthy threatened . i braved him to do 
 his worst . we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses 
 to talk it over . 

 " when i went down there i found him talking with his son , so i 
 smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone . 
 but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in 
 me seemed to come uppermost . he was urging his son to marry my 
 daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she 
 were a slut from off the streets . it drove me mad to think that i 
 and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a 
 man as this . could i not snap the bond ? i was already a dying and 
 a desperate man . though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb , 
 i knew that my own fate was sealed . but my memory and my girl ! 
 both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue . i 
 did it , mr. holmes . i would do it again . deeply as i have sinned , 
 i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it . but that my girl 
 should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more 
 than i could suffer . i struck him down with no more compunction 
 than if he had been some foul and venomous beast . his cry brought 
 back his son ; but i had gained the cover of the wood , though i 
 was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in 
 my flight . that is the true story , gentlemen , of all that 
 occurred . " 

 " well , it is not for me to judge you , " said holmes as the old man 
 signed the statement which had been drawn out . " i pray that we 
 may never be exposed to such a temptation . " 

 " i pray not , sir . and what do you intend to do ? " 

 " in view of your health , nothing . you are yourself aware that you 
 will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the 
 assizes . i will keep your confession , and if mccarthy is 
 condemned i shall be forced to use it . if not , it shall never be 
 seen by mortal eye ; and your secret , whether you be alive or 
 dead , shall be safe with us . " 

 " farewell , then , " said the old man solemnly . " your own deathbeds , 
 when they come , will be the easier for the thought of the peace 
 which you have given to mine . " tottering and shaking in all his 
 giant frame , he stumbled slowly from the room . 

 " god help us ! " said holmes after a long silence . " why does fate 
 play such tricks with poor , helpless worms ? i never hear of such 
 a case as this that i do not think of baxter 's words , and say , 
 ' there , but for the grace of god , goes sherlock holmes . ' " 

 james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a 
 number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and 
 submitted to the defending counsel . old turner lived for seven 
 months after our interview , but he is now dead ; and there is 
 every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily 
 together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their 
 past . 



 adventure v. the five orange pips 

 when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes 
 cases between the years ' 82 and ' 90 , i am faced by so many which 
 present strange and interesting features that it is no easy 
 matter to know which to choose and which to leave . some , however , 
 have already gained publicity through the papers , and others have 
 not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend 
 possessed in so high a degree , and which it is the object of 
 these papers to illustrate . some , too , have baffled his 
 analytical skill , and would be , as narratives , beginnings without 
 an ending , while others have been but partially cleared up , and 
 have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and 
 surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to 
 him . there is , however , one of these last which was so remarkable 
 in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted 
 to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are 
 points in connection with it which never have been , and probably 
 never will be , entirely cleared up . 

 the year ' 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater 
 or less interest , of which i retain the records . among my 
 headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the 
 adventure of the paradol chamber , of the amateur mendicant 
 society , who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a 
 furniture warehouse , of the facts connected with the loss of the 
 british barque " sophy anderson " , of the singular adventures of the 
 grice patersons in the island of uffa , and finally of the 
 camberwell poisoning case . in the latter , as may be remembered , 
 sherlock holmes was able , by winding up the dead man 's watch , to 
 prove that it had been wound up two hours before , and that 
 therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time -- a 
 deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the 
 case . all these i may sketch out at some future date , but none of 
 them present such singular features as the strange train of 
 circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe . 

 it was in the latter days of september , and the equinoctial gales 
 had set in with exceptional violence . all day the wind had 
 screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows , so that 
 even here in the heart of great , hand - made london we were forced 
 to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and 
 to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which 
 shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation , like 
 untamed beasts in a cage . as evening drew in , the storm grew 
 higher and louder , and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in 
 the chimney . sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the 
 fireplace cross - indexing his records of crime , while i at the 
 other was deep in one of clark russell 's fine sea - stories until 
 the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text , 
 and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of 
 the sea waves . my wife was on a visit to her mother 's , and for a 
 few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker 
 street . 

 " why , " said i , glancing up at my companion , " that was surely the 
 bell . who could come to - night ? some friend of yours , perhaps ? " 

 " except yourself i have none , " he answered . " i do not encourage 
 visitors . " 

 " a client , then ? " 

 " if so , it is a serious case . nothing less would bring a man out 
 on such a day and at such an hour . but i take it that it is more 
 likely to be some crony of the landlady 's . " 

 sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture , however , for there 
 came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door . he 
 stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and 
 towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit . 

 " come in ! " said he . 

 the man who entered was young , some two - and - twenty at the 
 outside , well - groomed and trimly clad , with something of 
 refinement and delicacy in his bearing . the streaming umbrella 
 which he held in his hand , and his long shining waterproof told 
 of the fierce weather through which he had come . he looked about 
 him anxiously in the glare of the lamp , and i could see that his 
 face was pale and his eyes heavy , like those of a man who is 
 weighed down with some great anxiety . 

 " i owe you an apology , " he said , raising his golden pince - nez to 
 his eyes . " i trust that i am not intruding . i fear that i have 
 brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug 
 chamber . " 

 " give me your coat and umbrella , " said holmes . " they may rest 
 here on the hook and will be dry presently . you have come up from 
 the south - west , i see . " 

 " yes , from horsham . " 

 " that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is 
 quite distinctive . " 

 " i have come for advice . " 

 " that is easily got . " 

 " and help . " 

 " that is not always so easy . " 

 " i have heard of you , mr. holmes . i heard from major prendergast 
 how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal . " 

 " ah , of course . he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards . " 

 " he said that you could solve anything . " 

 " he said too much . " 

 " that you are never beaten . " 

 " i have been beaten four times -- three times by men , and once by a 
 woman . " 

 " but what is that compared with the number of your successes ? " 

 " it is true that i have been generally successful . " 

 " then you may be so with me . " 

 " i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me 
 with some details as to your case . " 

 " it is no ordinary one . " 

 " none of those which come to me are . i am the last court of 
 appeal . " 

 " and yet i question , sir , whether , in all your experience , you 
 have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of 
 events than those which have happened in my own family . " 

 " you fill me with interest , " said holmes . " pray give us the 
 essential facts from the commencement , and i can afterwards 
 question you as to those details which seem to me to be most 
 important . " 

 the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out 
 towards the blaze . 

 " my name , " said he , " is john openshaw , but my own affairs have , 
 as far as i can understand , little to do with this awful 
 business . it is a hereditary matter ; so in order to give you an 
 idea of the facts , i must go back to the commencement of the 
 affair . 

 " you must know that my grandfather had two sons -- my uncle elias 
 and my father joseph . my father had a small factory at coventry , 
 which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling . he 
 was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire , and his business 
 met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire 
 upon a handsome competence . 

 " my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and 
 became a planter in florida , where he was reported to have done 
 very well . at the time of the war he fought in jackson 's army , 
 and afterwards under hood , where he rose to be a colonel . when 
 lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation , where 
 he remained for three or four years . about 1869 or 1870 he came 
 back to europe and took a small estate in sussex , near horsham . 
 he had made a very considerable fortune in the states , and his 
 reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes , and his 
 dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to 
 them . he was a singular man , fierce and quick - tempered , very 
 foul - mouthed when he was angry , and of a most retiring 
 disposition . during all the years that he lived at horsham , i 
 doubt if ever he set foot in the town . he had a garden and two or 
 three fields round his house , and there he would take his 
 exercise , though very often for weeks on end he would never leave 
 his room . he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very 
 heavily , but he would see no society and did not want any 
 friends , not even his own brother . 

 " he did n't mind me ; in fact , he took a fancy to me , for at the 
 time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so . this 
 would be in the year 1878 , after he had been eight or nine years 
 in england . he begged my father to let me live with him and he 
 was very kind to me in his way . when he was sober he used to be 
 fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me , and he would 
 make me his representative both with the servants and with the 
 tradespeople , so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite 
 master of the house . i kept all the keys and could go where i 
 liked and do what i liked , so long as i did not disturb him in 
 his privacy . there was one singular exception , however , for he 
 had a single room , a lumber - room up among the attics , which was 
 invariably locked , and which he would never permit either me or 
 anyone else to enter . with a boy 's curiosity i have peeped 
 through the keyhole , but i was never able to see more than such a 
 collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such 
 a room . 

 " one day -- it was in march , 1883 - -a letter with a foreign stamp 
 lay upon the table in front of the colonel 's plate . it was not a 
 common thing for him to receive letters , for his bills were all 
 paid in ready money , and he had no friends of any sort . ' from 
 india ! ' said he as he took it up , ' pondicherry postmark ! what can 
 this be ? ' opening it hurriedly , out there jumped five little 
 dried orange pips , which pattered down upon his plate . i began to 
 laugh at this , but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight 
 of his face . his lip had fallen , his eyes were protruding , his 
 skin the colour of putty , and he glared at the envelope which he 
 still held in his trembling hand , ' k. k. k. ! ' he shrieked , and 
 then , ' my god , my god , my sins have overtaken me ! ' 

 " ' what is it , uncle ? ' i cried . 

 " ' death , ' said he , and rising from the table he retired to his 
 room , leaving me palpitating with horror . i took up the envelope 
 and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap , just above the 
 gum , the letter k three times repeated . there was nothing else 
 save the five dried pips . what could be the reason of his 
 overpowering terror ? i left the breakfast - table , and as i 
 ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key , 
 which must have belonged to the attic , in one hand , and a small 
 brass box , like a cashbox , in the other . 

 " ' they may do what they like , but i 'll checkmate them still , ' 
 said he with an oath . ' tell mary that i shall want a fire in my 
 room to - day , and send down to fordham , the horsham lawyer . ' 

 " i did as he ordered , and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to 
 step up to the room . the fire was burning brightly , and in the 
 grate there was a mass of black , fluffy ashes , as of burned 
 paper , while the brass box stood open and empty beside it . as i 
 glanced at the box i noticed , with a start , that upon the lid was 
 printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the 
 envelope . 

 " ' i wish you , john , ' said my uncle , ' to witness my will . i leave 
 my estate , with all its advantages and all its disadvantages , to 
 my brother , your father , whence it will , no doubt , descend to 
 you . if you can enjoy it in peace , well and good ! if you find you 
 can not , take my advice , my boy , and leave it to your deadliest 
 enemy . i am sorry to give you such a two - edged thing , but i ca n't 
 say what turn things are going to take . kindly sign the paper 
 where mr. fordham shows you . ' 

 " i signed the paper as directed , and the lawyer took it away with 
 him . the singular incident made , as you may think , the deepest 
 impression upon me , and i pondered over it and turned it every 
 way in my mind without being able to make anything of it . yet i 
 could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left 
 behind , though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed 
 and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives . i 
 could see a change in my uncle , however . he drank more than ever , 
 and he was less inclined for any sort of society . most of his 
 time he would spend in his room , with the door locked upon the 
 inside , but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy 
 and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a 
 revolver in his hand , screaming out that he was afraid of no man , 
 and that he was not to be cooped up , like a sheep in a pen , by 
 man or devil . when these hot fits were over , however , he would 
 rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him , 
 like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror 
 which lies at the roots of his soul . at such times i have seen 
 his face , even on a cold day , glisten with moisture , as though it 
 were new raised from a basin . 

 " well , to come to an end of the matter , mr. holmes , and not to 
 abuse your patience , there came a night when he made one of those 
 drunken sallies from which he never came back . we found him , when 
 we went to search for him , face downward in a little 
 green - scummed pool , which lay at the foot of the garden . there 
 was no sign of any violence , and the water was but two feet deep , 
 so that the jury , having regard to his known eccentricity , 
 brought in a verdict of ' suicide . ' but i , who knew how he winced 
 from the very thought of death , had much ado to persuade myself 
 that he had gone out of his way to meet it . the matter passed , 
 however , and my father entered into possession of the estate , and 
 of some 14,000 pounds , which lay to his credit at the bank . " 

 " one moment , " holmes interposed , " your statement is , i foresee , 
 one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened . let me 
 have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter , and 
 the date of his supposed suicide . " 

 " the letter arrived on march 10 , 1883 . his death was seven weeks 
 later , upon the night of may 2nd . " 

 " thank you . pray proceed . " 

 " when my father took over the horsham property , he , at my 
 request , made a careful examination of the attic , which had been 
 always locked up . we found the brass box there , although its 
 contents had been destroyed . on the inside of the cover was a 
 paper label , with the initials of k. k. k. repeated upon it , and 
 ' letters , memoranda , receipts , and a register ' written beneath . 
 these , we presume , indicated the nature of the papers which had 
 been destroyed by colonel openshaw . for the rest , there was 
 nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many 
 scattered papers and note - books bearing upon my uncle 's life in 
 america . some of them were of the war time and showed that he had 
 done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier . 
 others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern 
 states , and were mostly concerned with politics , for he had 
 evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet - bag 
 politicians who had been sent down from the north . 

 " well , it was the beginning of ' 84 when my father came to live at 
 horsham , and all went as well as possible with us until the 
 january of ' 85 . on the fourth day after the new year i heard my 
 father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the 
 breakfast - table . there he was , sitting with a newly opened 
 envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the 
 outstretched palm of the other one . he had always laughed at what 
 he called my cock - and - bull story about the colonel , but he looked 
 very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon 
 himself . 

 " ' why , what on earth does this mean , john ? ' he stammered . 

 " my heart had turned to lead . ' it is k. k. k. , ' said i. 

 " he looked inside the envelope . ' so it is , ' he cried . ' here are 
 the very letters . but what is this written above them ? ' 

 " ' put the papers on the sundial , ' i read , peeping over his 
 shoulder . 

 " ' what papers ? what sundial ? ' he asked . 

 " ' the sundial in the garden . there is no other , ' said i ; ' but the 
 papers must be those that are destroyed . ' 

 " ' pooh ! ' said he , gripping hard at his courage . ' we are in a 
 civilised land here , and we ca n't have tomfoolery of this kind . 
 where does the thing come from ? ' 

 " ' from dundee , ' i answered , glancing at the postmark . 

 " ' some preposterous practical joke , ' said he . ' what have i to do 
 with sundials and papers ? i shall take no notice of such 
 nonsense . ' 

 " ' i should certainly speak to the police , ' i said . 

 " ' and be laughed at for my pains . nothing of the sort . ' 

 " ' then let me do so ? ' 

 " ' no , i forbid you . i wo n't have a fuss made about such 
 nonsense . ' 

 " it was in vain to argue with him , for he was a very obstinate 
 man . i went about , however , with a heart which was full of 
 forebodings . 

 " on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went 
 from home to visit an old friend of his , major freebody , who is 
 in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill . i was glad 
 that he should go , for it seemed to me that he was farther from 
 danger when he was away from home . in that , however , i was in 
 error . upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram 
 from the major , imploring me to come at once . my father had 
 fallen over one of the deep chalk - pits which abound in the 
 neighbourhood , and was lying senseless , with a shattered skull . i 
 hurried to him , but he passed away without having ever recovered 
 his consciousness . he had , as it appears , been returning from 
 fareham in the twilight , and as the country was unknown to him , 
 and the chalk - pit unfenced , the jury had no hesitation in 
 bringing in a verdict of ' death from accidental causes . ' 
 carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death , i 
 was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of 
 murder . there were no signs of violence , no footmarks , no 
 robbery , no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads . 
 and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease , 
 and that i was well - nigh certain that some foul plot had been 
 woven round him . 

 " in this sinister way i came into my inheritance . you will ask me 
 why i did not dispose of it ? i answer , because i was well 
 convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an 
 incident in my uncle 's life , and that the danger would be as 
 pressing in one house as in another . 

 " it was in january , ' 85 , that my poor father met his end , and two 
 years and eight months have elapsed since then . during that time 
 i have lived happily at horsham , and i had begun to hope that 
 this curse had passed away from the family , and that it had ended 
 with the last generation . i had begun to take comfort too soon , 
 however ; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in 
 which it had come upon my father . " 

 the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope , and 
 turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried 
 orange pips . 

 " this is the envelope , " he continued . " the postmark is 
 london -- eastern division . within are the very words which were 
 upon my father 's last message : ' k. k. k. ' ; and then ' put the 
 papers on the sundial . ' " 

 " what have you done ? " asked holmes . 

 " nothing . " 

 " nothing ? " 

 " to tell the truth "-- he sank his face into his thin , white 
 hands--"i have felt helpless . i have felt like one of those poor 
 rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it . i seem to be in 
 the grasp of some resistless , inexorable evil , which no foresight 
 and no precautions can guard against . " 

 " tut ! tut ! " cried sherlock holmes . " you must act , man , or you are 
 lost . nothing but energy can save you . this is no time for 
 despair . " 

 " i have seen the police . " 

 " ah ! " 

 " but they listened to my story with a smile . i am convinced that 
 the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all 
 practical jokes , and that the deaths of my relations were really 
 accidents , as the jury stated , and were not to be connected with 
 the warnings . " 

 holmes shook his clenched hands in the air . " incredible 
 imbecility ! " he cried . 

 " they have , however , allowed me a policeman , who may remain in 
 the house with me . " 

 " has he come with you to - night ? " 

 " no . his orders were to stay in the house . " 

 again holmes raved in the air . 

 " why did you come to me , " he cried , " and , above all , why did you 
 not come at once ? " 

 " i did not know . it was only to - day that i spoke to major 
 prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to 
 you . " 

 " it is really two days since you had the letter . we should have 
 acted before this . you have no further evidence , i suppose , than 
 that which you have placed before us -- no suggestive detail which 
 might help us ? " 

 " there is one thing , " said john openshaw . he rummaged in his coat 
 pocket , and , drawing out a piece of discoloured , blue - tinted 
 paper , he laid it out upon the table . " i have some remembrance , " 
 said he , " that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i 
 observed that the small , unburned margins which lay amid the 
 ashes were of this particular colour . i found this single sheet 
 upon the floor of his room , and i am inclined to think that it 
 may be one of the papers which has , perhaps , fluttered out from 
 among the others , and in that way has escaped destruction . beyond 
 the mention of pips , i do not see that it helps us much . i think 
 myself that it is a page from some private diary . the writing is 
 undoubtedly my uncle 's . " 

 holmes moved the lamp , and we both bent over the sheet of paper , 
 which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from 
 a book . it was headed , " march , 1869 , " and beneath were the 
 following enigmatical notices : 

 " 4th . hudson came . same old platform . 

 " 7th . set the pips on mccauley , paramore , and 
       john swain , of st. augustine . 

 " 9th . mccauley cleared . 

 " 10th . john swain cleared . 

 " 12th . visited paramore . all well . " 

 " thank you ! " said holmes , folding up the paper and returning it 
 to our visitor . " and now you must on no account lose another 
 instant . we can not spare time even to discuss what you have told 
 me . you must get home instantly and act . " 

 " what shall i do ? " 

 " there is but one thing to do . it must be done at once . you must 
 put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass 
 box which you have described . you must also put in a note to say 
 that all the other papers were burned by your uncle , and that 
 this is the only one which remains . you must assert that in such 
 words as will carry conviction with them . having done this , you 
 must at once put the box out upon the sundial , as directed . do 
 you understand ? " 

 " entirely . " 

 " do not think of revenge , or anything of the sort , at present . i 
 think that we may gain that by means of the law ; but we have our 
 web to weave , while theirs is already woven . the first 
 consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens 
 you . the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the 
 guilty parties . " 

 " i thank you , " said the young man , rising and pulling on his 
 overcoat . " you have given me fresh life and hope . i shall 
 certainly do as you advise . " 

 " do not lose an instant . and , above all , take care of yourself in 
 the meanwhile , for i do not think that there can be a doubt that 
 you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger . how do you 
 go back ? " 

 " by train from waterloo . " 

 " it is not yet nine . the streets will be crowded , so i trust that 
 you may be in safety . and yet you can not guard yourself too 
 closely . " 

 " i am armed . " 

 " that is well . to - morrow i shall set to work upon your case . " 

 " i shall see you at horsham , then ? " 

 " no , your secret lies in london . it is there that i shall seek 
 it . " 

 " then i shall call upon you in a day , or in two days , with news 
 as to the box and the papers . i shall take your advice in every 
 particular . " he shook hands with us and took his leave . outside 
 the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered 
 against the windows . this strange , wild story seemed to have come 
 to us from amid the mad elements -- blown in upon us like a sheet 
 of sea - weed in a gale -- and now to have been reabsorbed by them 
 once more . 

 sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence , with his head sunk 
 forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire . then he 
 lit his pipe , and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue 
 smoke - rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling . 

 " i think , watson , " he remarked at last , " that of all our cases we 
 have had none more fantastic than this . " 

 " save , perhaps , the sign of four . " 

 " well , yes . save , perhaps , that . and yet this john openshaw seems 
 to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the 
 sholtos . " 

 " but have you , " i asked , " formed any definite conception as to 
 what these perils are ? " 

 " there can be no question as to their nature , " he answered . 

 " then what are they ? who is this k. k. k. , and why does he pursue 
 this unhappy family ? " 

 sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the 
 arms of his chair , with his finger - tips together . " the ideal 
 reasoner , " he remarked , " would , when he had once been shown a 
 single fact in all its bearings , deduce from it not only all the 
 chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which 
 would follow from it . as cuvier could correctly describe a whole 
 animal by the contemplation of a single bone , so the observer who 
 has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents 
 should be able to accurately state all the other ones , both 
 before and after . we have not yet grasped the results which the 
 reason alone can attain to . problems may be solved in the study 
 which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the 
 aid of their senses . to carry the art , however , to its highest 
 pitch , it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to 
 utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge ; and this 
 in itself implies , as you will readily see , a possession of all 
 knowledge , which , even in these days of free education and 
 encyclopaedias , is a somewhat rare accomplishment . it is not so 
 impossible , however , that a man should possess all knowledge 
 which is likely to be useful to him in his work , and this i have 
 endeavoured in my case to do . if i remember rightly , you on one 
 occasion , in the early days of our friendship , defined my limits 
 in a very precise fashion . " 

 " yes , " i answered , laughing . " it was a singular document . 
 philosophy , astronomy , and politics were marked at zero , i 
 remember . botany variable , geology profound as regards the 
 mud - stains from any region within fifty miles of town , chemistry 
 eccentric , anatomy unsystematic , sensational literature and crime 
 records unique , violin - player , boxer , swordsman , lawyer , and 
 self - poisoner by cocaine and tobacco . those , i think , were the 
 main points of my analysis . " 

 holmes grinned at the last item . " well , " he said , " i say now , as 
 i said then , that a man should keep his little brain - attic 
 stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use , and the 
 rest he can put away in the lumber - room of his library , where he 
 can get it if he wants it . now , for such a case as the one which 
 has been submitted to us to - night , we need certainly to muster 
 all our resources . kindly hand me down the letter k of the 
 ' american encyclopaedia ' which stands upon the shelf beside you . 
 thank you . now let us consider the situation and see what may be 
 deduced from it . in the first place , we may start with a strong 
 presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for 
 leaving america . men at his time of life do not change all their 
 habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for 
 the lonely life of an english provincial town . his extreme love 
 of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of 
 someone or something , so we may assume as a working hypothesis 
 that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from 
 america . as to what it was he feared , we can only deduce that by 
 considering the formidable letters which were received by himself 
 and his successors . did you remark the postmarks of those 
 letters ? " 

 " the first was from pondicherry , the second from dundee , and the 
 third from london . " 

 " from east london . what do you deduce from that ? " 

 " they are all seaports . that the writer was on board of a ship . " 

 " excellent . we have already a clue . there can be no doubt that 
 the probability -- the strong probability -- is that the writer was 
 on board of a ship . and now let us consider another point . in the 
 case of pondicherry , seven weeks elapsed between the threat and 
 its fulfilment , in dundee it was only some three or four days . 
 does that suggest anything ? " 

 " a greater distance to travel . " 

 " but the letter had also a greater distance to come . " 

 " then i do not see the point . " 

 " there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man 
 or men are is a sailing - ship . it looks as if they always send 
 their singular warning or token before them when starting upon 
 their mission . you see how quickly the deed followed the sign 
 when it came from dundee . if they had come from pondicherry in a 
 steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter . 
 but , as a matter of fact , seven weeks elapsed . i think that those 
 seven weeks represented the difference between the mail - boat which 
 brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the 
 writer . " 

 " it is possible . " 

 " more than that . it is probable . and now you see the deadly 
 urgency of this new case , and why i urged young openshaw to 
 caution . the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which 
 it would take the senders to travel the distance . but this one 
 comes from london , and therefore we can not count upon delay . " 

 " good god ! " i cried . " what can it mean , this relentless 
 persecution ? " 

 " the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital 
 importance to the person or persons in the sailing - ship . i think 
 that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them . 
 a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way 
 as to deceive a coroner 's jury . there must have been several in 
 it , and they must have been men of resource and determination . 
 their papers they mean to have , be the holder of them who it may . 
 in this way you see k. k. k. ceases to be the initials of an 
 individual and becomes the badge of a society . " 

 " but of what society ? " 

 " have you never-- " said sherlock holmes , bending forward and 
 sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the ku klux klan ? " 

 " i never have . " 

 holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee . " here it 
 is , " said he presently : 

 " ' ku klux klan . a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to 
 the sound produced by cocking a rifle . this terrible secret 
 society was formed by some ex - confederate soldiers in the 
 southern states after the civil war , and it rapidly formed local 
 branches in different parts of the country , notably in tennessee , 
 louisiana , the carolinas , georgia , and florida . its power was 
 used for political purposes , principally for the terrorising of 
 the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country 
 of those who were opposed to its views . its outrages were usually 
 preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic 
 but generally recognised shape -- a sprig of oak - leaves in some 
 parts , melon seeds or orange pips in others . on receiving this 
 the victim might either openly abjure his former ways , or might 
 fly from the country . if he braved the matter out , death would 
 unfailingly come upon him , and usually in some strange and 
 unforeseen manner . so perfect was the organisation of the 
 society , and so systematic its methods , that there is hardly a 
 case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with 
 impunity , or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the 
 perpetrators . for some years the organisation flourished in spite 
 of the efforts of the united states government and of the better 
 classes of the community in the south . eventually , in the year 
 1869 , the movement rather suddenly collapsed , although there have 
 been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date . ' 

 " you will observe , " said holmes , laying down the volume , " that 
 the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the 
 disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers . it may 
 well have been cause and effect . it is no wonder that he and his 
 family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track . 
 you can understand that this register and diary may implicate 
 some of the first men in the south , and that there may be many 
 who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered . " 

 " then the page we have seen-- " 

 " is such as we might expect . it ran , if i remember right , ' sent 
 the pips to a , b , and c'--that is , sent the society 's warning to 
 them . then there are successive entries that a and b cleared , or 
 left the country , and finally that c was visited , with , i fear , a 
 sinister result for c. well , i think , doctor , that we may let 
 some light into this dark place , and i believe that the only 
 chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have 
 told him . there is nothing more to be said or to be done 
 to - night , so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for 
 half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable 
 ways of our fellow - men . " 


 it had cleared in the morning , and the sun was shining with a 
 subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the 
 great city . sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came 
 down . 

 " you will excuse me for not waiting for you , " said he ; " i have , i 
 foresee , a very busy day before me in looking into this case of 
 young openshaw 's . " 

 " what steps will you take ? " i asked . 

 " it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries . 
 i may have to go down to horsham , after all . " 

 " you will not go there first ? " 

 " no , i shall commence with the city . just ring the bell and the 
 maid will bring up your coffee . " 

 as i waited , i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and 
 glanced my eye over it . it rested upon a heading which sent a 
 chill to my heart . 

 " holmes , " i cried , " you are too late . " 

 " ah ! " said he , laying down his cup , " i feared as much . how was it 
 done ? " he spoke calmly , but i could see that he was deeply moved . 

 " my eye caught the name of openshaw , and the heading ' tragedy 
 near waterloo bridge . ' here is the account : 

 " between nine and ten last night police - constable cook , of the h 
 division , on duty near waterloo bridge , heard a cry for help and 
 a splash in the water . the night , however , was extremely dark and 
 stormy , so that , in spite of the help of several passers - by , it 
 was quite impossible to effect a rescue . the alarm , however , was 
 given , and , by the aid of the water - police , the body was 
 eventually recovered . it proved to be that of a young gentleman 
 whose name , as it appears from an envelope which was found in his 
 pocket , was john openshaw , and whose residence is near horsham . 
 it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch 
 the last train from waterloo station , and that in his haste and 
 the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge 
 of one of the small landing - places for river steamboats . the body 
 exhibited no traces of violence , and there can be no doubt that 
 the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident , 
 which should have the effect of calling the attention of the 
 authorities to the condition of the riverside landing - stages . " 

 we sat in silence for some minutes , holmes more depressed and 
 shaken than i had ever seen him . 

 " that hurts my pride , watson , " he said at last . " it is a petty 
 feeling , no doubt , but it hurts my pride . it becomes a personal 
 matter with me now , and , if god sends me health , i shall set my 
 hand upon this gang . that he should come to me for help , and that 
 i should send him away to his death-- ! " he sprang from his chair 
 and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation , with a 
 flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and 
 unclasping of his long thin hands . 

 " they must be cunning devils , " he exclaimed at last . " how could 
 they have decoyed him down there ? the embankment is not on the 
 direct line to the station . the bridge , no doubt , was too 
 crowded , even on such a night , for their purpose . well , watson , 
 we shall see who will win in the long run . i am going out now ! " 

 " to the police ? " 

 " no ; i shall be my own police . when i have spun the web they may 
 take the flies , but not before . " 

 all day i was engaged in my professional work , and it was late in 
 the evening before i returned to baker street . sherlock holmes 
 had not come back yet . it was nearly ten o'clock before he 
 entered , looking pale and worn . he walked up to the sideboard , 
 and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously , 
 washing it down with a long draught of water . 

 " you are hungry , " i remarked . 

 " starving . it had escaped my memory . i have had nothing since 
 breakfast . " 

 " nothing ? " 

 " not a bite . i had no time to think of it . " 

 " and how have you succeeded ? " 

 " well . " 

 " you have a clue ? " 

 " i have them in the hollow of my hand . young openshaw shall not 
 long remain unavenged . why , watson , let us put their own devilish 
 trade - mark upon them . it is well thought of ! " 

 " what do you mean ? " 

 he took an orange from the cupboard , and tearing it to pieces he 
 squeezed out the pips upon the table . of these he took five and 
 thrust them into an envelope . on the inside of the flap he wrote 
 " s. h. for j. o. " then he sealed it and addressed it to " captain 
 james calhoun , barque ' lone star , ' savannah , georgia . " 

 " that will await him when he enters port , " said he , chuckling . 
 " it may give him a sleepless night . he will find it as sure a 
 precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him . " 

 " and who is this captain calhoun ? " 

 " the leader of the gang . i shall have the others , but he first . " 

 " how did you trace it , then ? " 

 he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket , all covered with 
 dates and names . 

 " i have spent the whole day , " said he , " over lloyd 's registers 
 and files of the old papers , following the future career of every 
 vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 
 ' 83 . there were thirty - six ships of fair tonnage which were 
 reported there during those months . of these , one , the ' lone star , ' 
 instantly attracted my attention , since , although it was reported 
 as having cleared from london , the name is that which is given to 
 one of the states of the union . " 

 " texas , i think . " 

 " i was not and am not sure which ; but i knew that the ship must 
 have an american origin . " 

 " what then ? " 

 " i searched the dundee records , and when i found that the barque 
 ' lone star ' was there in january , ' 85 , my suspicion became a 
 certainty . i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present 
 in the port of london . " 

 " yes ? " 

 " the ' lone star ' had arrived here last week . i went down to the 
 albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by 
 the early tide this morning , homeward bound to savannah . i wired 
 to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago , and 
 as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the 
 goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight . " 

 " what will you do , then ? " 

 " oh , i have my hand upon him . he and the two mates , are as i 
 learn , the only native - born americans in the ship . the others are 
 finns and germans . i know , also , that they were all three away 
 from the ship last night . i had it from the stevedore who has 
 been loading their cargo . by the time that their sailing - ship 
 reaches savannah the mail - boat will have carried this letter , and 
 the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these 
 three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder . " 

 there is ever a flaw , however , in the best laid of human plans , 
 and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the 
 orange pips which would show them that another , as cunning and as 
 resolute as themselves , was upon their track . very long and very 
 severe were the equinoctial gales that year . we waited long for 
 news of the " lone star " of savannah , but none ever reached us . we 
 did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a 
 shattered stern - post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough 
 of a wave , with the letters " l. s. " carved upon it , and that is 
 all which we shall ever know of the fate of the " lone star . " 



 adventure vi . the man with the twisted lip 

 isa whitney , brother of the late elias whitney , d.d. , principal 
 of the theological college of st. george 's , was much addicted to 
 opium . the habit grew upon him , as i understand , from some 
 foolish freak when he was at college ; for having read de 
 quincey 's description of his dreams and sensations , he had 
 drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the 
 same effects . he found , as so many more have done , that the 
 practice is easier to attain than to get rid of , and for many 
 years he continued to be a slave to the drug , an object of 
 mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives . i can see 
 him now , with yellow , pasty face , drooping lids , and pin - point 
 pupils , all huddled in a chair , the wreck and ruin of a noble 
 man . 

 one night -- it was in june , ' 89 - -there came a ring to my bell , 
 about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the 
 clock . i sat up in my chair , and my wife laid her needle - work 
 down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment . 

 " a patient ! " said she . " you 'll have to go out . " 

 i groaned , for i was newly come back from a weary day . 

 we heard the door open , a few hurried words , and then quick steps 
 upon the linoleum . our own door flew open , and a lady , clad in 
 some dark - coloured stuff , with a black veil , entered the room . 

 " you will excuse my calling so late , " she began , and then , 
 suddenly losing her self - control , she ran forward , threw her arms 
 about my wife 's neck , and sobbed upon her shoulder . " oh , i 'm in 
 such trouble ! " she cried ; " i do so want a little help . " 

 " why , " said my wife , pulling up her veil , " it is kate whitney . 
 how you startled me , kate ! i had not an idea who you were when 
 you came in . " 

 " i did n't know what to do , so i came straight to you . " that was 
 always the way . folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds 
 to a light - house . 

 " it was very sweet of you to come . now , you must have some wine 
 and water , and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it . or 
 should you rather that i sent james off to bed ? " 

 " oh , no , no ! i want the doctor 's advice and help , too . it 's about 
 isa . he has not been home for two days . i am so frightened about 
 him ! " 

 it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her 
 husband 's trouble , to me as a doctor , to my wife as an old friend 
 and school companion . we soothed and comforted her by such words 
 as we could find . did she know where her husband was ? was it 
 possible that we could bring him back to her ? 

 it seems that it was . she had the surest information that of late 
 he had , when the fit was on him , made use of an opium den in the 
 farthest east of the city . hitherto his orgies had always been 
 confined to one day , and he had come back , twitching and 
 shattered , in the evening . but now the spell had been upon him 
 eight - and - forty hours , and he lay there , doubtless among the 
 dregs of the docks , breathing in the poison or sleeping off the 
 effects . there he was to be found , she was sure of it , at the bar 
 of gold , in upper swandam lane . but what was she to do ? how could 
 she , a young and timid woman , make her way into such a place and 
 pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him ? 

 there was the case , and of course there was but one way out of 
 it . might i not escort her to this place ? and then , as a second 
 thought , why should she come at all ? i was isa whitney 's medical 
 adviser , and as such i had influence over him . i could manage it 
 better if i were alone . i promised her on my word that i would 
 send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the 
 address which she had given me . and so in ten minutes i had left 
 my armchair and cheery sitting - room behind me , and was speeding 
 eastward in a hansom on a strange errand , as it seemed to me at 
 the time , though the future only could show how strange it was to 
 be . 

 but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my 
 adventure . upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the 
 high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east 
 of london bridge . between a slop - shop and a gin - shop , approached 
 by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the 
 mouth of a cave , i found the den of which i was in search . 
 ordering my cab to wait , i passed down the steps , worn hollow in 
 the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet ; and by the 
 light of a flickering oil - lamp above the door i found the latch 
 and made my way into a long , low room , thick and heavy with the 
 brown opium smoke , and terraced with wooden berths , like the 
 forecastle of an emigrant ship . 

 through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying 
 in strange fantastic poses , bowed shoulders , bent knees , heads 
 thrown back , and chins pointing upward , with here and there a 
 dark , lack - lustre eye turned upon the newcomer . out of the black 
 shadows there glimmered little red circles of light , now bright , 
 now faint , as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of 
 the metal pipes . the most lay silent , but some muttered to 
 themselves , and others talked together in a strange , low , 
 monotonous voice , their conversation coming in gushes , and then 
 suddenly tailing off into silence , each mumbling out his own 
 thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour . at 
 the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal , beside 
 which on a three - legged wooden stool there sat a tall , thin old 
 man , with his jaw resting upon his two fists , and his elbows upon 
 his knees , staring into the fire . 

 as i entered , a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe 
 for me and a supply of the drug , beckoning me to an empty berth . 

 " thank you . i have not come to stay , " said i. " there is a friend 
 of mine here , mr. isa whitney , and i wish to speak with him . " 

 there was a movement and an exclamation from my right , and 
 peering through the gloom , i saw whitney , pale , haggard , and 
 unkempt , staring out at me . 

 " my god ! it 's watson , " said he . he was in a pitiable state of 
 reaction , with every nerve in a twitter . " i say , watson , what 
 o'clock is it ? " 

 " nearly eleven . " 

 " of what day ? " 

 " of friday , june 19th . " 

 " good heavens ! i thought it was wednesday . it is wednesday . what 
 d'you want to frighten a chap for ? " he sank his face onto his 
 arms and began to sob in a high treble key . 

 " i tell you that it is friday , man . your wife has been waiting 
 this two days for you . you should be ashamed of yourself ! " 

 " so i am . but you 've got mixed , watson , for i have only been here 
 a few hours , three pipes , four pipes -- i forget how many . but i 'll 
 go home with you . i would n't frighten kate -- poor little kate . 
 give me your hand ! have you a cab ? " 

 " yes , i have one waiting . " 

 " then i shall go in it . but i must owe something . find what i 
 owe , watson . i am all off colour . i can do nothing for myself . " 

 i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of 
 sleepers , holding my breath to keep out the vile , stupefying 
 fumes of the drug , and looking about for the manager . as i passed 
 the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my 
 skirt , and a low voice whispered , " walk past me , and then look 
 back at me . " the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear . i 
 glanced down . they could only have come from the old man at my 
 side , and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever , very thin , very 
 wrinkled , bent with age , an opium pipe dangling down from between 
 his knees , as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his 
 fingers . i took two steps forward and looked back . it took all my 
 self - control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of 
 astonishment . he had turned his back so that none could see him 
 but i. his form had filled out , his wrinkles were gone , the dull 
 eyes had regained their fire , and there , sitting by the fire and 
 grinning at my surprise , was none other than sherlock holmes . he 
 made a slight motion to me to approach him , and instantly , as he 
 turned his face half round to the company once more , subsided 
 into a doddering , loose - lipped senility . 

 " holmes ! " i whispered , " what on earth are you doing in this den ? " 

 " as low as you can , " he answered ; " i have excellent ears . if you 
 would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend 
 of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with 
 you . " 

 " i have a cab outside . " 

 " then pray send him home in it . you may safely trust him , for he 
 appears to be too limp to get into any mischief . i should 
 recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to 
 say that you have thrown in your lot with me . if you will wait 
 outside , i shall be with you in five minutes . " 

 it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes ' requests , for 
 they were always so exceedingly definite , and put forward with 
 such a quiet air of mastery . i felt , however , that when whitney 
 was once confined in the cab my mission was practically 
 accomplished ; and for the rest , i could not wish anything better 
 than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular 
 adventures which were the normal condition of his existence . in a 
 few minutes i had written my note , paid whitney 's bill , led him 
 out to the cab , and seen him driven through the darkness . in a 
 very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den , 
 and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes . for two 
 streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot . 
 then , glancing quickly round , he straightened himself out and 
 burst into a hearty fit of laughter . 

 " i suppose , watson , " said he , " that you imagine that i have added 
 opium - smoking to cocaine injections , and all the other little 
 weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical 
 views . " 

 " i was certainly surprised to find you there . " 

 " but not more so than i to find you . " 

 " i came to find a friend . " 

 " and i to find an enemy . " 

 " an enemy ? " 

 " yes ; one of my natural enemies , or , shall i say , my natural 
 prey . briefly , watson , i am in the midst of a very remarkable 
 inquiry , and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent 
 ramblings of these sots , as i have done before now . had i been 
 recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an 
 hour 's purchase ; for i have used it before now for my own 
 purposes , and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have 
 vengeance upon me . there is a trap - door at the back of that 
 building , near the corner of paul 's wharf , which could tell some 
 strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless 
 nights . " 

 " what ! you do not mean bodies ? " 

 " ay , bodies , watson . we should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds 
 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den . it 
 is the vilest murder - trap on the whole riverside , and i fear that 
 neville st. clair has entered it never to leave it more . but our 
 trap should be here . " he put his two forefingers between his 
 teeth and whistled shrilly -- a signal which was answered by a 
 similar whistle from the distance , followed shortly by the rattle 
 of wheels and the clink of horses ' hoofs . 

 " now , watson , " said holmes , as a tall dog - cart dashed up through 
 the gloom , throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from 
 its side lanterns . " you 'll come with me , wo n't you ? " 

 " if i can be of use . " 

 " oh , a trusty comrade is always of use ; and a chronicler still 
 more so . my room at the cedars is a double - bedded one . " 

 " the cedars ? " 

 " yes ; that is mr. st. clair 's house . i am staying there while i 
 conduct the inquiry . " 

 " where is it , then ? " 

 " near lee , in kent . we have a seven - mile drive before us . " 

 " but i am all in the dark . " 

 " of course you are . you 'll know all about it presently . jump up 
 here . all right , john ; we shall not need you . here 's half a 
 crown . look out for me to - morrow , about eleven . give her her 
 head . so long , then ! " 

 he flicked the horse with his whip , and we dashed away through 
 the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets , which 
 widened gradually , until we were flying across a broad 
 balustraded bridge , with the murky river flowing sluggishly 
 beneath us . beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and 
 mortar , its silence broken only by the heavy , regular footfall of 
 the policeman , or the songs and shouts of some belated party of 
 revellers . a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky , and a 
 star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of 
 the clouds . holmes drove in silence , with his head sunk upon his 
 breast , and the air of a man who is lost in thought , while i sat 
 beside him , curious to learn what this new quest might be which 
 seemed to tax his powers so sorely , and yet afraid to break in 
 upon the current of his thoughts . we had driven several miles , 
 and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban 
 villas , when he shook himself , shrugged his shoulders , and lit up 
 his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he 
 is acting for the best . 

 " you have a grand gift of silence , watson , " said he . " it makes 
 you quite invaluable as a companion . ' pon my word , it is a great 
 thing for me to have someone to talk to , for my own thoughts are 
 not over - pleasant . i was wondering what i should say to this dear 
 little woman to - night when she meets me at the door . " 

 " you forget that i know nothing about it . " 

 " i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before 
 we get to lee . it seems absurdly simple , and yet , somehow i can 
 get nothing to go upon . there 's plenty of thread , no doubt , but i 
 ca n't get the end of it into my hand . now , i 'll state the case 
 clearly and concisely to you , watson , and maybe you can see a 
 spark where all is dark to me . " 

 " proceed , then . " 

 " some years ago -- to be definite , in may , 1884 - -there came to lee 
 a gentleman , neville st. clair by name , who appeared to have 
 plenty of money . he took a large villa , laid out the grounds very 
 nicely , and lived generally in good style . by degrees he made 
 friends in the neighbourhood , and in 1887 he married the daughter 
 of a local brewer , by whom he now has two children . he had no 
 occupation , but was interested in several companies and went into 
 town as a rule in the morning , returning by the 5:14 from cannon 
 street every night . mr. st. clair is now thirty - seven years of 
 age , is a man of temperate habits , a good husband , a very 
 affectionate father , and a man who is popular with all who know 
 him . i may add that his whole debts at the present moment , as far 
 as we have been able to ascertain , amount to 88 pounds 10s . , while 
 he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the capital and 
 counties bank . there is no reason , therefore , to think that money 
 troubles have been weighing upon his mind . 

 " last monday mr. neville st. clair went into town rather earlier 
 than usual , remarking before he started that he had two important 
 commissions to perform , and that he would bring his little boy 
 home a box of bricks . now , by the merest chance , his wife 
 received a telegram upon this same monday , very shortly after his 
 departure , to the effect that a small parcel of considerable 
 value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the 
 offices of the aberdeen shipping company . now , if you are well up 
 in your london , you will know that the office of the company is 
 in fresno street , which branches out of upper swandam lane , where 
 you found me to - night . mrs. st. clair had her lunch , started for 
 the city , did some shopping , proceeded to the company 's office , 
 got her packet , and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through 
 swandam lane on her way back to the station . have you followed me 
 so far ? " 

 " it is very clear . " 

 " if you remember , monday was an exceedingly hot day , and mrs. st. 
 clair walked slowly , glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab , 
 as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself . 
 while she was walking in this way down swandam lane , she suddenly 
 heard an ejaculation or cry , and was struck cold to see her 
 husband looking down at her and , as it seemed to her , beckoning 
 to her from a second - floor window . the window was open , and she 
 distinctly saw his face , which she describes as being terribly 
 agitated . he waved his hands frantically to her , and then 
 vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that 
 he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind . 
 one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that 
 although he wore some dark coat , such as he had started to town 
 in , he had on neither collar nor necktie . 

 " convinced that something was amiss with him , she rushed down the 
 steps -- for the house was none other than the opium den in which 
 you found me to - night -- and running through the front room she 
 attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor . at 
 the foot of the stairs , however , she met this lascar scoundrel of 
 whom i have spoken , who thrust her back and , aided by a dane , who 
 acts as assistant there , pushed her out into the street . filled 
 with the most maddening doubts and fears , she rushed down the 
 lane and , by rare good - fortune , met in fresno street a number of 
 constables with an inspector , all on their way to their beat . the 
 inspector and two men accompanied her back , and in spite of the 
 continued resistance of the proprietor , they made their way to 
 the room in which mr. st. clair had last been seen . there was no 
 sign of him there . in fact , in the whole of that floor there was 
 no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect , who , 
 it seems , made his home there . both he and the lascar stoutly 
 swore that no one else had been in the front room during the 
 afternoon . so determined was their denial that the inspector was 
 staggered , and had almost come to believe that mrs. st. clair had 
 been deluded when , with a cry , she sprang at a small deal box 
 which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it . out there fell 
 a cascade of children 's bricks . it was the toy which he had 
 promised to bring home . 

 " this discovery , and the evident confusion which the cripple 
 showed , made the inspector realise that the matter was serious . 
 the rooms were carefully examined , and results all pointed to an 
 abominable crime . the front room was plainly furnished as a 
 sitting - room and led into a small bedroom , which looked out upon 
 the back of one of the wharves . between the wharf and the bedroom 
 window is a narrow strip , which is dry at low tide but is covered 
 at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water . the 
 bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below . on 
 examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill , 
 and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of 
 the bedroom . thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were 
 all the clothes of mr. neville st. clair , with the exception of 
 his coat . his boots , his socks , his hat , and his watch -- all were 
 there . there were no signs of violence upon any of these 
 garments , and there were no other traces of mr. neville st. 
 clair . out of the window he must apparently have gone for no 
 other exit could be discovered , and the ominous bloodstains upon 
 the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by 
 swimming , for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of 
 the tragedy . 

 " and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately 
 implicated in the matter . the lascar was known to be a man of the 
 vilest antecedents , but as , by mrs. st. clair 's story , he was 
 known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few 
 seconds of her husband 's appearance at the window , he could 
 hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime . his defence 
 was one of absolute ignorance , and he protested that he had no 
 knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone , his lodger , and that he 
 could not account in any way for the presence of the missing 
 gentleman 's clothes . 

 " so much for the lascar manager . now for the sinister cripple who 
 lives upon the second floor of the opium den , and who was 
 certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st. 
 clair . his name is hugh boone , and his hideous face is one which 
 is familiar to every man who goes much to the city . he is a 
 professional beggar , though in order to avoid the police 
 regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas . some 
 little distance down threadneedle street , upon the left - hand 
 side , there is , as you may have remarked , a small angle in the 
 wall . here it is that this creature takes his daily seat , 
 cross - legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap , and as he 
 is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the 
 greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him . i 
 have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of 
 making his professional acquaintance , and i have been surprised 
 at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time . his 
 appearance , you see , is so remarkable that no one can pass him 
 without observing him . a shock of orange hair , a pale face 
 disfigured by a horrible scar , which , by its contraction , has 
 turned up the outer edge of his upper lip , a bulldog chin , and a 
 pair of very penetrating dark eyes , which present a singular 
 contrast to the colour of his hair , all mark him out from amid 
 the common crowd of mendicants and so , too , does his wit , for he 
 is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be 
 thrown at him by the passers - by . this is the man whom we now 
 learn to have been the lodger at the opium den , and to have been 
 the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest . " 

 " but a cripple ! " said i. " what could he have done single - handed 
 against a man in the prime of life ? " 

 " he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp ; but in 
 other respects he appears to be a powerful and well - nurtured man . 
 surely your medical experience would tell you , watson , that 
 weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional 
 strength in the others . " 

 " pray continue your narrative . " 

 " mrs. st. clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the 
 window , and she was escorted home in a cab by the police , as her 
 presence could be of no help to them in their investigations . 
 inspector barton , who had charge of the case , made a very careful 
 examination of the premises , but without finding anything which 
 threw any light upon the matter . one mistake had been made in not 
 arresting boone instantly , as he was allowed some few minutes 
 during which he might have communicated with his friend the 
 lascar , but this fault was soon remedied , and he was seized and 
 searched , without anything being found which could incriminate 
 him . there were , it is true , some blood - stains upon his right 
 shirt - sleeve , but he pointed to his ring - finger , which had been 
 cut near the nail , and explained that the bleeding came from 
 there , adding that he had been to the window not long before , and 
 that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from 
 the same source . he denied strenuously having ever seen mr. 
 neville st. clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in 
 his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police . as to 
 mrs. st. clair 's assertion that she had actually seen her husband 
 at the window , he declared that she must have been either mad or 
 dreaming . he was removed , loudly protesting , to the 
 police - station , while the inspector remained upon the premises in 
 the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue . 

 " and it did , though they hardly found upon the mud - bank what they 
 had feared to find . it was neville st. clair 's coat , and not 
 neville st. clair , which lay uncovered as the tide receded . and 
 what do you think they found in the pockets ? " 

 " i can not imagine . " 

 " no , i do n't think you would guess . every pocket stuffed with 
 pennies and half - pennies--421 pennies and 270 half - pennies . it 
 was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide . but a 
 human body is a different matter . there is a fierce eddy between 
 the wharf and the house . it seemed likely enough that the 
 weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked 
 away into the river . " 

 " but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the 
 room . would the body be dressed in a coat alone ? " 

 " no , sir , but the facts might be met speciously enough . suppose 
 that this man boone had thrust neville st. clair through the 
 window , there is no human eye which could have seen the deed . 
 what would he do then ? it would of course instantly strike him 
 that he must get rid of the tell - tale garments . he would seize 
 the coat , then , and be in the act of throwing it out , when it 
 would occur to him that it would swim and not sink . he has little 
 time , for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried 
 to force her way up , and perhaps he has already heard from his 
 lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street . 
 there is not an instant to be lost . he rushes to some secret 
 hoard , where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary , and he 
 stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the 
 pockets to make sure of the coat 's sinking . he throws it out , and 
 would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard 
 the rush of steps below , and only just had time to close the 
 window when the police appeared . " 

 " it certainly sounds feasible . " 

 " well , we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a 
 better . boone , as i have told you , was arrested and taken to the 
 station , but it could not be shown that there had ever before 
 been anything against him . he had for years been known as a 
 professional beggar , but his life appeared to have been a very 
 quiet and innocent one . there the matter stands at present , and 
 the questions which have to be solved -- what neville st. clair was 
 doing in the opium den , what happened to him when there , where is 
 he now , and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance -- are 
 all as far from a solution as ever . i confess that i can not 
 recall any case within my experience which looked at the first 
 glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties . " 

 while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of 
 events , we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great 
 town until the last straggling houses had been left behind , and 
 we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us . 
 just as he finished , however , we drove through two scattered 
 villages , where a few lights still glimmered in the windows . 

 " we are on the outskirts of lee , " said my companion . " we have 
 touched on three english counties in our short drive , starting in 
 middlesex , passing over an angle of surrey , and ending in kent . 
 see that light among the trees ? that is the cedars , and beside 
 that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already , i have 
 little doubt , caught the clink of our horse 's feet . " 

 " but why are you not conducting the case from baker street ? " i 
 asked . 

 " because there are many inquiries which must be made out here . 
 mrs. st. clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal , and 
 you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for 
 my friend and colleague . i hate to meet her , watson , when i have 
 no news of her husband . here we are . whoa , there , whoa ! " 

 we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its 
 own grounds . a stable - boy had run out to the horse 's head , and 
 springing down , i followed holmes up the small , winding 
 gravel - drive which led to the house . as we approached , the door 
 flew open , and a little blonde woman stood in the opening , clad 
 in some sort of light mousseline de soie , with a touch of fluffy 
 pink chiffon at her neck and wrists . she stood with her figure 
 outlined against the flood of light , one hand upon the door , one 
 half - raised in her eagerness , her body slightly bent , her head 
 and face protruded , with eager eyes and parted lips , a standing 
 question . 

 " well ? " she cried , " well ? " and then , seeing that there were two 
 of us , she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw 
 that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders . 

 " no good news ? " 

 " none . " 

 " no bad ? " 

 " no . " 

 " thank god for that . but come in . you must be weary , for you have 
 had a long day . " 

 " this is my friend , dr. watson . he has been of most vital use to 
 me in several of my cases , and a lucky chance has made it 
 possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this 
 investigation . " 

 " i am delighted to see you , " said she , pressing my hand warmly . 
 " you will , i am sure , forgive anything that may be wanting in our 
 arrangements , when you consider the blow which has come so 
 suddenly upon us . " 

 " my dear madam , " said i , " i am an old campaigner , and if i were 
 not i can very well see that no apology is needed . if i can be of 
 any assistance , either to you or to my friend here , i shall be 
 indeed happy . " 

 " now , mr. sherlock holmes , " said the lady as we entered a 
 well - lit dining - room , upon the table of which a cold supper had 
 been laid out , " i should very much like to ask you one or two 
 plain questions , to which i beg that you will give a plain 
 answer . " 

 " certainly , madam . " 

 " do not trouble about my feelings . i am not hysterical , nor given 
 to fainting . i simply wish to hear your real , real opinion . " 

 " upon what point ? " 

 " in your heart of hearts , do you think that neville is alive ? " 

 sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question . 
 " frankly , now ! " she repeated , standing upon the rug and looking 
 keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket - chair . 

 " frankly , then , madam , i do not . " 

 " you think that he is dead ? " 

 " i do . " 

 " murdered ? " 

 " i do n't say that . perhaps . " 

 " and on what day did he meet his death ? " 

 " on monday . " 

 " then perhaps , mr. holmes , you will be good enough to explain how 
 it is that i have received a letter from him to - day . " 

 sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been 
 galvanised . 

 " what ! " he roared . 

 " yes , to - day . " she stood smiling , holding up a little slip of 
 paper in the air . 

 " may i see it ? " 

 " certainly . " 

 he snatched it from her in his eagerness , and smoothing it out 
 upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently . i 
 had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder . the 
 envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend 
 postmark and with the date of that very day , or rather of the day 
 before , for it was considerably after midnight . 

 " coarse writing , " murmured holmes . " surely this is not your 
 husband 's writing , madam . " 

 " no , but the enclosure is . " 

 " i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go 
 and inquire as to the address . " 

 " how can you tell that ? " 

 " the name , you see , is in perfectly black ink , which has dried 
 itself . the rest is of the greyish colour , which shows that 
 blotting - paper has been used . if it had been written straight 
 off , and then blotted , none would be of a deep black shade . this 
 man has written the name , and there has then been a pause before 
 he wrote the address , which can only mean that he was not 
 familiar with it . it is , of course , a trifle , but there is 
 nothing so important as trifles . let us now see the letter . ha ! 
 there has been an enclosure here ! " 

 " yes , there was a ring . his signet - ring . " 

 " and you are sure that this is your husband 's hand ? " 

 " one of his hands . " 

 " one ? " 

 " his hand when he wrote hurriedly . it is very unlike his usual 
 writing , and yet i know it well . " 

 " ' dearest do not be frightened . all will come well . there is a 
 huge error which it may take some little time to rectify . 
 wait in patience .-- neville . ' written in pencil upon the fly - leaf 
 of a book , octavo size , no water - mark . hum ! posted to - day in 
 gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb . ha ! and the flap has been 
 gummed , if i am not very much in error , by a person who had been 
 chewing tobacco . and you have no doubt that it is your husband 's 
 hand , madam ? " 

 " none . neville wrote those words . " 

 " and they were posted to - day at gravesend . well , mrs. st. clair , 
 the clouds lighten , though i should not venture to say that the 
 danger is over . " 

 " but he must be alive , mr. holmes . " 

 " unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent . 
 the ring , after all , proves nothing . it may have been taken from 
 him . " 

 " no , no ; it is , it is his very own writing ! " 

 " very well . it may , however , have been written on monday and only 
 posted to - day . " 

 " that is possible . " 

 " if so , much may have happened between . " 

 " oh , you must not discourage me , mr. holmes . i know that all is 
 well with him . there is so keen a sympathy between us that i 
 should know if evil came upon him . on the very day that i saw him 
 last he cut himself in the bedroom , and yet i in the dining - room 
 rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that 
 something had happened . do you think that i would respond to such 
 a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death ? " 

 " i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman 
 may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical 
 reasoner . and in this letter you certainly have a very strong 
 piece of evidence to corroborate your view . but if your husband 
 is alive and able to write letters , why should he remain away 
 from you ? " 

 " i can not imagine . it is unthinkable . " 

 " and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you ? " 

 " no . " 

 " and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane ? " 

 " very much so . " 

 " was the window open ? " 

 " yes . " 

 " then he might have called to you ? " 

 " he might . " 

 " he only , as i understand , gave an inarticulate cry ? " 

 " yes . " 

 " a call for help , you thought ? " 

 " yes . he waved his hands . " 

 " but it might have been a cry of surprise . astonishment at the 
 unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands ? " 

 " it is possible . " 

 " and you thought he was pulled back ? " 

 " he disappeared so suddenly . " 

 " he might have leaped back . you did not see anyone else in the 
 room ? " 

 " no , but this horrible man confessed to having been there , and 
 the lascar was at the foot of the stairs . " 

 " quite so . your husband , as far as you could see , had his 
 ordinary clothes on ? " 

 " but without his collar or tie . i distinctly saw his bare 
 throat . " 

 " had he ever spoken of swandam lane ? " 

 " never . " 

 " had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium ? " 

 " never . " 

 " thank you , mrs. st. clair . those are the principal points about 
 which i wished to be absolutely clear . we shall now have a little 
 supper and then retire , for we may have a very busy day 
 to - morrow . " 

 a large and comfortable double - bedded room had been placed at our 
 disposal , and i was quickly between the sheets , for i was weary 
 after my night of adventure . sherlock holmes was a man , however , 
 who , when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind , would go for 
 days , and even for a week , without rest , turning it over , 
 rearranging his facts , looking at it from every point of view 
 until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his 
 data were insufficient . it was soon evident to me that he was now 
 preparing for an all - night sitting . he took off his coat and 
 waistcoat , put on a large blue dressing - gown , and then wandered 
 about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from 
 the sofa and armchairs . with these he constructed a sort of 
 eastern divan , upon which he perched himself cross - legged , with 
 an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front 
 of him . in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there , an 
 old briar pipe between his lips , his eyes fixed vacantly upon the 
 corner of the ceiling , the blue smoke curling up from him , 
 silent , motionless , with the light shining upon his strong - set 
 aquiline features . so he sat as i dropped off to sleep , and so he 
 sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up , and i found 
 the summer sun shining into the apartment . the pipe was still 
 between his lips , the smoke still curled upward , and the room was 
 full of a dense tobacco haze , but nothing remained of the heap of 
 shag which i had seen upon the previous night . 

 " awake , watson ? " he asked . 

 " yes . " 

 " game for a morning drive ? " 

 " certainly . " 

 " then dress . no one is stirring yet , but i know where the 
 stable - boy sleeps , and we shall soon have the trap out . " he 
 chuckled to himself as he spoke , his eyes twinkled , and he seemed 
 a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night . 

 as i dressed i glanced at my watch . it was no wonder that no one 
 was stirring . it was twenty - five minutes past four . i had hardly 
 finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was 
 putting in the horse . 

 " i want to test a little theory of mine , " said he , pulling on his 
 boots . " i think , watson , that you are now standing in the 
 presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe . i deserve 
 to be kicked from here to charing cross . but i think i have the 
 key of the affair now . " 

 " and where is it ? " i asked , smiling . 

 " in the bathroom , " he answered . " oh , yes , i am not joking , " he 
 continued , seeing my look of incredulity . " i have just been 
 there , and i have taken it out , and i have got it in this 
 gladstone bag . come on , my boy , and we shall see whether it will 
 not fit the lock . " 

 we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible , and out into 
 the bright morning sunshine . in the road stood our horse and 
 trap , with the half - clad stable - boy waiting at the head . we both 
 sprang in , and away we dashed down the london road . a few country 
 carts were stirring , bearing in vegetables to the metropolis , but 
 the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as 
 some city in a dream . 

 " it has been in some points a singular case , " said holmes , 
 flicking the horse on into a gallop . " i confess that i have been 
 as blind as a mole , but it is better to learn wisdom late than 
 never to learn it at all . " 

 in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily 
 from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey 
 side . passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the 
 river , and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the 
 right and found ourselves in bow street . sherlock holmes was well 
 known to the force , and the two constables at the door saluted 
 him . one of them held the horse 's head while the other led us in . 

 " who is on duty ? " asked holmes . 

 " inspector bradstreet , sir . " 

 " ah , bradstreet , how are you ? " a tall , stout official had come 
 down the stone - flagged passage , in a peaked cap and frogged 
 jacket . " i wish to have a quiet word with you , bradstreet . " 
 " certainly , mr. holmes . step into my room here . " it was a small , 
 office - like room , with a huge ledger upon the table , and a 
 telephone projecting from the wall . the inspector sat down at his 
 desk . 

 " what can i do for you , mr. holmes ? " 

 " i called about that beggarman , boone -- the one who was charged 
 with being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. 
 clair , of lee . " 

 " yes . he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries . " 

 " so i heard . you have him here ? " 

 " in the cells . " 

 " is he quiet ? " 

 " oh , he gives no trouble . but he is a dirty scoundrel . " 

 " dirty ? " 

 " yes , it is all we can do to make him wash his hands , and his 
 face is as black as a tinker 's . well , when once his case has been 
 settled , he will have a regular prison bath ; and i think , if you 
 saw him , you would agree with me that he needed it . " 

 " i should like to see him very much . " 

 " would you ? that is easily done . come this way . you can leave 
 your bag . " 

 " no , i think that i 'll take it . " 

 " very good . come this way , if you please . " he led us down a 
 passage , opened a barred door , passed down a winding stair , and 
 brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each 
 side . 

 " the third on the right is his , " said the inspector . " here it 
 is ! " he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door 
 and glanced through . 

 " he is asleep , " said he . " you can see him very well . " 

 we both put our eyes to the grating . the prisoner lay with his 
 face towards us , in a very deep sleep , breathing slowly and 
 heavily . he was a middle - sized man , coarsely clad as became his 
 calling , with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his 
 tattered coat . he was , as the inspector had said , extremely 
 dirty , but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its 
 repulsive ugliness . a broad wheal from an old scar ran right 
 across it from eye to chin , and by its contraction had turned up 
 one side of the upper lip , so that three teeth were exposed in a 
 perpetual snarl . a shock of very bright red hair grew low over 
 his eyes and forehead . 

 " he 's a beauty , is n't he ? " said the inspector . 

 " he certainly needs a wash , " remarked holmes . " i had an idea that 
 he might , and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me . " 
 he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke , and took out , to my 
 astonishment , a very large bath - sponge . 

 " he ! he ! you are a funny one , " chuckled the inspector . 

 " now , if you will have the great goodness to open that door very 
 quietly , we will soon make him cut a much more respectable 
 figure . " 

 " well , i do n't know why not , " said the inspector . " he does n't 
 look a credit to the bow street cells , does he ? " he slipped his 
 key into the lock , and we all very quietly entered the cell . the 
 sleeper half turned , and then settled down once more into a deep 
 slumber . holmes stooped to the water - jug , moistened his sponge , 
 and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the 
 prisoner 's face . 

 " let me introduce you , " he shouted , " to mr. neville st. clair , of 
 lee , in the county of kent . " 

 never in my life have i seen such a sight . the man 's face peeled 
 off under the sponge like the bark from a tree . gone was the 
 coarse brown tint ! gone , too , was the horrid scar which had 
 seamed it across , and the twisted lip which had given the 
 repulsive sneer to the face ! a twitch brought away the tangled 
 red hair , and there , sitting up in his bed , was a pale , 
 sad - faced , refined - looking man , black - haired and smooth - skinned , 
 rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment . 
 then suddenly realising the exposure , he broke into a scream and 
 threw himself down with his face to the pillow . 

 " great heavens ! " cried the inspector , " it is , indeed , the missing 
 man . i know him from the photograph . " 

 the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons 
 himself to his destiny . " be it so , " said he . " and pray what am i 
 charged with ? " 

 " with making away with mr. neville st.-- oh , come , you ca n't be 
 charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of 
 it , " said the inspector with a grin . " well , i have been 
 twenty - seven years in the force , but this really takes the cake . " 

 " if i am mr. neville st. clair , then it is obvious that no crime 
 has been committed , and that , therefore , i am illegally 
 detained . " 

 " no crime , but a very great error has been committed , " said 
 holmes . " you would have done better to have trusted your wife . " 

 " it was not the wife ; it was the children , " groaned the prisoner . 
 " god help me , i would not have them ashamed of their father . my 
 god ! what an exposure ! what can i do ? " 

 sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him 
 kindly on the shoulder . 

 " if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up , " said 
 he , " of course you can hardly avoid publicity . on the other hand , 
 if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible 
 case against you , i do not know that there is any reason that the 
 details should find their way into the papers . inspector 
 bradstreet would , i am sure , make notes upon anything which you 
 might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities . the case 
 would then never go into court at all . " 

 " god bless you ! " cried the prisoner passionately . " i would have 
 endured imprisonment , ay , even execution , rather than have left 
 my miserable secret as a family blot to my children . 

 " you are the first who have ever heard my story . my father was a 
 schoolmaster in chesterfield , where i received an excellent 
 education . i travelled in my youth , took to the stage , and 
 finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london . one day 
 my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the 
 metropolis , and i volunteered to supply them . there was the point 
 from which all my adventures started . it was only by trying 
 begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to 
 base my articles . when an actor i had , of course , learned all the 
 secrets of making up , and had been famous in the green - room for 
 my skill . i took advantage now of my attainments . i painted my 
 face , and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good 
 scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a 
 small slip of flesh - coloured plaster . then with a red head of 
 hair , and an appropriate dress , i took my station in the business 
 part of the city , ostensibly as a match - seller but really as a 
 beggar . for seven hours i plied my trade , and when i returned 
 home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no 
 less than 26s . 4d . 

 " i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until , 
 some time later , i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ 
 served upon me for 25 pounds . i was at my wit 's end where to get 
 the money , but a sudden idea came to me . i begged a fortnight 's 
 grace from the creditor , asked for a holiday from my employers , 
 and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise . in 
 ten days i had the money and had paid the debt . 

 " well , you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous 
 work at 2 pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in 
 a day by smearing my face with a little paint , laying my cap on 
 the ground , and sitting still . it was a long fight between my 
 pride and the money , but the dollars won at last , and i threw up 
 reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first 
 chosen , inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets 
 with coppers . only one man knew my secret . he was the keeper of a 
 low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane , where i could 
 every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings 
 transform myself into a well - dressed man about town . this fellow , 
 a lascar , was well paid by me for his rooms , so that i knew that 
 my secret was safe in his possession . 

 " well , very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of 
 money . i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london 
 could earn 700 pounds a year -- which is less than my average 
 takings -- but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making 
 up , and also in a facility of repartee , which improved by 
 practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city . 
 all day a stream of pennies , varied by silver , poured in upon me , 
 and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take 2 pounds . 

 " as i grew richer i grew more ambitious , took a house in the 
 country , and eventually married , without anyone having a 
 suspicion as to my real occupation . my dear wife knew that i had 
 business in the city . she little knew what . 

 " last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my 
 room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw , 
 to my horror and astonishment , that my wife was standing in the 
 street , with her eyes fixed full upon me . i gave a cry of 
 surprise , threw up my arms to cover my face , and , rushing to my 
 confidant , the lascar , entreated him to prevent anyone from 
 coming up to me . i heard her voice downstairs , but i knew that 
 she could not ascend . swiftly i threw off my clothes , pulled on 
 those of a beggar , and put on my pigments and wig . even a wife 's 
 eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise . but then it 
 occurred to me that there might be a search in the room , and that 
 the clothes might betray me . i threw open the window , reopening 
 by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in 
 the bedroom that morning . then i seized my coat , which was 
 weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from 
 the leather bag in which i carried my takings . i hurled it out of 
 the window , and it disappeared into the thames . the other clothes 
 would have followed , but at that moment there was a rush of 
 constables up the stair , and a few minutes after i found , rather , 
 i confess , to my relief , that instead of being identified as mr. 
 neville st. clair , i was arrested as his murderer . 

 " i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain . i 
 was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible , and 
 hence my preference for a dirty face . knowing that my wife would 
 be terribly anxious , i slipped off my ring and confided it to the 
 lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me , together 
 with a hurried scrawl , telling her that she had no cause to 
 fear . " 

 " that note only reached her yesterday , " said holmes . 

 " good god ! what a week she must have spent ! " 

 " the police have watched this lascar , " said inspector bradstreet , 
 " and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to 
 post a letter unobserved . probably he handed it to some sailor 
 customer of his , who forgot all about it for some days . " 

 " that was it , " said holmes , nodding approvingly ; " i have no doubt 
 of it . but have you never been prosecuted for begging ? " 

 " many times ; but what was a fine to me ? " 

 " it must stop here , however , " said bradstreet . " if the police are 
 to hush this thing up , there must be no more of hugh boone . " 

 " i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take . " 

 " in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps 
 may be taken . but if you are found again , then all must come out . 
 i am sure , mr. holmes , that we are very much indebted to you for 
 having cleared the matter up . i wish i knew how you reach your 
 results . " 

 " i reached this one , " said my friend , " by sitting upon five 
 pillows and consuming an ounce of shag . i think , watson , that if 
 we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast . " 



 vii . the adventure of the blue carbuncle 

 i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second 
 morning after christmas , with the intention of wishing him the 
 compliments of the season . he was lounging upon the sofa in a 
 purple dressing - gown , a pipe - rack within his reach upon the 
 right , and a pile of crumpled morning papers , evidently newly 
 studied , near at hand . beside the couch was a wooden chair , and 
 on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable 
 hard - felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several 
 places . a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair 
 suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the 
 purpose of examination . 

 " you are engaged , " said i ; " perhaps i interrupt you . " 

 " not at all . i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss 
 my results . the matter is a perfectly trivial one "-- he jerked his 
 thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in 
 connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and 
 even of instruction . " 

 i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his 
 crackling fire , for a sharp frost had set in , and the windows 
 were thick with the ice crystals . " i suppose , " i remarked , " that , 
 homely as it looks , this thing has some deadly story linked on to 
 it -- that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of 
 some mystery and the punishment of some crime . " 

 " no , no . no crime , " said sherlock holmes , laughing . " only one of 
 those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have 
 four million human beings all jostling each other within the 
 space of a few square miles . amid the action and reaction of so 
 dense a swarm of humanity , every possible combination of events 
 may be expected to take place , and many a little problem will be 
 presented which may be striking and bizarre without being 
 criminal . we have already had experience of such . " 

 " so much so , " i remarked , " that of the last six cases which i 
 have added to my notes , three have been entirely free of any 
 legal crime . " 

 " precisely . you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler 
 papers , to the singular case of miss mary sutherland , and to the 
 adventure of the man with the twisted lip . well , i have no doubt 
 that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category . 
 you know peterson , the commissionaire ? " 

 " yes . " 

 " it is to him that this trophy belongs . " 

 " it is his hat . " 

 " no , no , he found it . its owner is unknown . i beg that you will 
 look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual 
 problem . and , first , as to how it came here . it arrived upon 
 christmas morning , in company with a good fat goose , which is , i 
 have no doubt , roasting at this moment in front of peterson 's 
 fire . the facts are these : about four o'clock on christmas 
 morning , peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , was 
 returning from some small jollification and was making his way 
 homeward down tottenham court road . in front of him he saw , in 
 the gaslight , a tallish man , walking with a slight stagger , and 
 carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder . as he reached the 
 corner of goodge street , a row broke out between this stranger 
 and a little knot of roughs . one of the latter knocked off the 
 man 's hat , on which he raised his stick to defend himself and , 
 swinging it over his head , smashed the shop window behind him . 
 peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his 
 assailants ; but the man , shocked at having broken the window , and 
 seeing an official - looking person in uniform rushing towards him , 
 dropped his goose , took to his heels , and vanished amid the 
 labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham 
 court road . the roughs had also fled at the appearance of 
 peterson , so that he was left in possession of the field of 
 battle , and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this 
 battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose . " 

 " which surely he restored to their owner ? " 

 " my dear fellow , there lies the problem . it is true that ' for 
 mrs. henry baker ' was printed upon a small card which was tied to 
 the bird 's left leg , and it is also true that the initials ' h. 
 b. ' are legible upon the lining of this hat , but as there are 
 some thousands of bakers , and some hundreds of henry bakers in 
 this city of ours , it is not easy to restore lost property to any 
 one of them . " 

 " what , then , did peterson do ? " 

 " he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning , 
 knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me . 
 the goose we retained until this morning , when there were signs 
 that , in spite of the slight frost , it would be well that it 
 should be eaten without unnecessary delay . its finder has carried 
 it off , therefore , to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose , 
 while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who 
 lost his christmas dinner . " 

 " did he not advertise ? " 

 " no . " 

 " then , what clue could you have as to his identity ? " 

 " only as much as we can deduce . " 

 " from his hat ? " 

 " precisely . " 

 " but you are joking . what can you gather from this old battered 
 felt ? " 

 " here is my lens . you know my methods . what can you gather 
 yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this 
 article ? " 

 i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather 
 ruefully . it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round 
 shape , hard and much the worse for wear . the lining had been of 
 red silk , but was a good deal discoloured . there was no maker 's 
 name ; but , as holmes had remarked , the initials " h. b. " were 
 scrawled upon one side . it was pierced in the brim for a 
 hat - securer , but the elastic was missing . for the rest , it was 
 cracked , exceedingly dusty , and spotted in several places , 
 although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the 
 discoloured patches by smearing them with ink . 

 " i can see nothing , " said i , handing it back to my friend . 

 " on the contrary , watson , you can see everything . you fail , 
 however , to reason from what you see . you are too timid in 
 drawing your inferences . " 

 " then , pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat ? " 

 he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective 
 fashion which was characteristic of him . " it is perhaps less 
 suggestive than it might have been , " he remarked , " and yet there 
 are a few inferences which are very distinct , and a few others 
 which represent at least a strong balance of probability . that 
 the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the 
 face of it , and also that he was fairly well - to - do within the 
 last three years , although he has now fallen upon evil days . he 
 had foresight , but has less now than formerly , pointing to a 
 moral retrogression , which , when taken with the decline of his 
 fortunes , seems to indicate some evil influence , probably drink , 
 at work upon him . this may account also for the obvious fact that 
 his wife has ceased to love him . " 

 " my dear holmes ! " 

 " he has , however , retained some degree of self - respect , " he 
 continued , disregarding my remonstrance . " he is a man who leads a 
 sedentary life , goes out little , is out of training entirely , is 
 middle - aged , has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the 
 last few days , and which he anoints with lime - cream . these are 
 the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat . also , 
 by the way , that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid 
 on in his house . " 

 " you are certainly joking , holmes . " 

 " not in the least . is it possible that even now , when i give you 
 these results , you are unable to see how they are attained ? " 

 " i have no doubt that i am very stupid , but i must confess that i 
 am unable to follow you . for example , how did you deduce that 
 this man was intellectual ? " 

 for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head . it came right 
 over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose . " it is 
 a question of cubic capacity , " said he ; " a man with so large a 
 brain must have something in it . " 

 " the decline of his fortunes , then ? " 

 " this hat is three years old . these flat brims curled at the edge 
 came in then . it is a hat of the very best quality . look at the 
 band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining . if this man could 
 afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago , and has had no 
 hat since , then he has assuredly gone down in the world . " 

 " well , that is clear enough , certainly . but how about the 
 foresight and the moral retrogression ? " 

 sherlock holmes laughed . " here is the foresight , " said he putting 
 his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat - securer . 
 " they are never sold upon hats . if this man ordered one , it is a 
 sign of a certain amount of foresight , since he went out of his 
 way to take this precaution against the wind . but since we see 
 that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace 
 it , it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly , 
 which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature . on the other 
 hand , he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the 
 felt by daubing them with ink , which is a sign that he has not 
 entirely lost his self - respect . " 

 " your reasoning is certainly plausible . " 

 " the further points , that he is middle - aged , that his hair is 
 grizzled , that it has been recently cut , and that he uses 
 lime - cream , are all to be gathered from a close examination of the 
 lower part of the lining . the lens discloses a large number of 
 hair - ends , clean cut by the scissors of the barber . they all 
 appear to be adhesive , and there is a distinct odour of 
 lime - cream . this dust , you will observe , is not the gritty , grey 
 dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house , 
 showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time , while 
 the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the 
 wearer perspired very freely , and could therefore , hardly be in 
 the best of training . " 

 " but his wife -- you said that she had ceased to love him . " 

 " this hat has not been brushed for weeks . when i see you , my dear 
 watson , with a week 's accumulation of dust upon your hat , and 
 when your wife allows you to go out in such a state , i shall fear 
 that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife 's 
 affection . " 

 " but he might be a bachelor . " 

 " nay , he was bringing home the goose as a peace - offering to his 
 wife . remember the card upon the bird 's leg . " 

 " you have an answer to everything . but how on earth do you deduce 
 that the gas is not laid on in his house ? " 

 " one tallow stain , or even two , might come by chance ; but when i 
 see no less than five , i think that there can be little doubt 
 that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with 
 burning tallow -- walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in 
 one hand and a guttering candle in the other . anyhow , he never 
 got tallow - stains from a gas - jet . are you satisfied ? " 

 " well , it is very ingenious , " said i , laughing ; " but since , as 
 you said just now , there has been no crime committed , and no harm 
 done save the loss of a goose , all this seems to be rather a 
 waste of energy . " 

 sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply , when the door flew 
 open , and peterson , the commissionaire , rushed into the apartment 
 with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with 
 astonishment . 

 " the goose , mr. holmes ! the goose , sir ! " he gasped . 

 " eh ? what of it , then ? has it returned to life and flapped off 
 through the kitchen window ? " holmes twisted himself round upon 
 the sofa to get a fairer view of the man 's excited face . 

 " see here , sir ! see what my wife found in its crop ! " he held out 
 his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly 
 scintillating blue stone , rather smaller than a bean in size , but 
 of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric 
 point in the dark hollow of his hand . 

 sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle . " by jove , peterson ! " said 
 he , " this is treasure trove indeed . i suppose you know what you 
 have got ? " 

 " a diamond , sir ? a precious stone . it cuts into glass as though 
 it were putty . " 

 " it 's more than a precious stone . it is the precious stone . " 

 " not the countess of morcar 's blue carbuncle ! " i ejaculated . 

 " precisely so . i ought to know its size and shape , seeing that i 
 have read the advertisement about it in the times every day 
 lately . it is absolutely unique , and its value can only be 
 conjectured , but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly 
 not within a twentieth part of the market price . " 

 " a thousand pounds ! great lord of mercy ! " the commissionaire 
 plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us . 

 " that is the reward , and i have reason to know that there are 
 sentimental considerations in the background which would induce 
 the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but 
 recover the gem . " 

 " it was lost , if i remember aright , at the hotel cosmopolitan , " i 
 remarked . 

 " precisely so , on december 22nd , just five days ago . john horner , 
 a plumber , was accused of having abstracted it from the lady 's 
 jewel - case . the evidence against him was so strong that the case 
 has been referred to the assizes . i have some account of the 
 matter here , i believe . " he rummaged amid his newspapers , 
 glancing over the dates , until at last he smoothed one out , 
 doubled it over , and read the following paragraph : 

 " hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery . john horner , 26 , plumber , was 
 brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst . , 
 abstracted from the jewel - case of the countess of morcar the 
 valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle . james ryder , 
 upper - attendant at the hotel , gave his evidence to the effect 
 that he had shown horner up to the dressing - room of the countess 
 of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might 
 solder the second bar of the grate , which was loose . he had 
 remained with horner some little time , but had finally been 
 called away . on returning , he found that horner had disappeared , 
 that the bureau had been forced open , and that the small morocco 
 casket in which , as it afterwards transpired , the countess was 
 accustomed to keep her jewel , was lying empty upon the 
 dressing - table . ryder instantly gave the alarm , and horner was 
 arrested the same evening ; but the stone could not be found 
 either upon his person or in his rooms . catherine cusack , maid to 
 the countess , deposed to having heard ryder 's cry of dismay on 
 discovering the robbery , and to having rushed into the room , 
 where she found matters as described by the last witness . 
 inspector bradstreet , b division , gave evidence as to the arrest 
 of horner , who struggled frantically , and protested his innocence 
 in the strongest terms . evidence of a previous conviction for 
 robbery having been given against the prisoner , the magistrate 
 refused to deal summarily with the offence , but referred it to 
 the assizes . horner , who had shown signs of intense emotion 
 during the proceedings , fainted away at the conclusion and was 
 carried out of court . " 

 " hum ! so much for the police - court , " said holmes thoughtfully , 
 tossing aside the paper . " the question for us now to solve is the 
 sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel - case at one end to 
 the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other . you 
 see , watson , our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much 
 more important and less innocent aspect . here is the stone ; the 
 stone came from the goose , and the goose came from mr. henry 
 baker , the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other 
 characteristics with which i have bored you . so now we must set 
 ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and 
 ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery . to 
 do this , we must try the simplest means first , and these lie 
 undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers . if 
 this fail , i shall have recourse to other methods . " 

 " what will you say ? " 

 " give me a pencil and that slip of paper . now , then : ' found at 
 the corner of goodge street , a goose and a black felt hat . mr. 
 henry baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 
 221b , baker street . ' that is clear and concise . " 

 " very . but will he see it ? " 

 " well , he is sure to keep an eye on the papers , since , to a poor 
 man , the loss was a heavy one . he was clearly so scared by his 
 mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson 
 that he thought of nothing but flight , but since then he must 
 have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his 
 bird . then , again , the introduction of his name will cause him to 
 see it , for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to 
 it . here you are , peterson , run down to the advertising agency 
 and have this put in the evening papers . " 

 " in which , sir ? " 

 " oh , in the globe , star , pall mall , st. james 's , evening news , 
 standard , echo , and any others that occur to you . " 

 " very well , sir . and this stone ? " 

 " ah , yes , i shall keep the stone . thank you . and , i say , 
 peterson , just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here 
 with me , for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place 
 of the one which your family is now devouring . " 

 when the commissionaire had gone , holmes took up the stone and 
 held it against the light . " it 's a bonny thing , " said he . " just 
 see how it glints and sparkles . of course it is a nucleus and 
 focus of crime . every good stone is . they are the devil 's pet 
 baits . in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a 
 bloody deed . this stone is not yet twenty years old . it was found 
 in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable 
 in having every characteristic of the carbuncle , save that it is 
 blue in shade instead of ruby red . in spite of its youth , it has 
 already a sinister history . there have been two murders , a 
 vitriol - throwing , a suicide , and several robberies brought about 
 for the sake of this forty - grain weight of crystallised charcoal . 
 who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the 
 gallows and the prison ? i 'll lock it up in my strong box now and 
 drop a line to the countess to say that we have it . " 

 " do you think that this man horner is innocent ? " 

 " i can not tell . " 

 " well , then , do you imagine that this other one , henry baker , had 
 anything to do with the matter ? " 

 " it is , i think , much more likely that henry baker is an 
 absolutely innocent man , who had no idea that the bird which he 
 was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made 
 of solid gold . that , however , i shall determine by a very simple 
 test if we have an answer to our advertisement . " 

 " and you can do nothing until then ? " 

 " nothing . " 

 " in that case i shall continue my professional round . but i shall 
 come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned , for i 
 should like to see the solution of so tangled a business . " 

 " very glad to see you . i dine at seven . there is a woodcock , i 
 believe . by the way , in view of recent occurrences , perhaps i 
 ought to ask mrs. hudson to examine its crop . " 

 i had been delayed at a case , and it was a little after half - past 
 six when i found myself in baker street once more . as i 
 approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a 
 coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the 
 bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight . just as i 
 arrived the door was opened , and we were shown up together to 
 holmes ' room . 

 " mr. henry baker , i believe , " said he , rising from his armchair 
 and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he 
 could so readily assume . " pray take this chair by the fire , mr. 
 baker . it is a cold night , and i observe that your circulation is 
 more adapted for summer than for winter . ah , watson , you have 
 just come at the right time . is that your hat , mr. baker ? " 

 " yes , sir , that is undoubtedly my hat . " 

 he was a large man with rounded shoulders , a massive head , and a 
 broad , intelligent face , sloping down to a pointed beard of 
 grizzled brown . a touch of red in nose and cheeks , with a slight 
 tremor of his extended hand , recalled holmes ' surmise as to his 
 habits . his rusty black frock - coat was buttoned right up in 
 front , with the collar turned up , and his lank wrists protruded 
 from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt . he spoke in a 
 slow staccato fashion , choosing his words with care , and gave the 
 impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had 
 ill - usage at the hands of fortune . 

 " we have retained these things for some days , " said holmes , 
 " because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your 
 address . i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise . " 

 our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh . " shillings have not 
 been so plentiful with me as they once were , " he remarked . " i had 
 no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off 
 both my hat and the bird . i did not care to spend more money in a 
 hopeless attempt at recovering them . " 

 " very naturally . by the way , about the bird , we were compelled to 
 eat it . " 

 " to eat it ! " our visitor half rose from his chair in his 
 excitement . 

 " yes , it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so . 
 but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard , which is 
 about the same weight and perfectly fresh , will answer your 
 purpose equally well ? " 

 " oh , certainly , certainly , " answered mr. baker with a sigh of 
 relief . 

 " of course , we still have the feathers , legs , crop , and so on of 
 your own bird , so if you wish-- " 

 the man burst into a hearty laugh . " they might be useful to me as 
 relics of my adventure , " said he , " but beyond that i can hardly 
 see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are 
 going to be to me . no , sir , i think that , with your permission , i 
 will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive 
 upon the sideboard . " 

 sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug 
 of his shoulders . 

 " there is your hat , then , and there your bird , " said he . " by the 
 way , would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one 
 from ? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier , and i have seldom seen a 
 better grown goose . " 

 " certainly , sir , " said baker , who had risen and tucked his newly 
 gained property under his arm . " there are a few of us who 
 frequent the alpha inn , near the museum -- we are to be found in 
 the museum itself during the day , you understand . this year our 
 good host , windigate by name , instituted a goose club , by which , 
 on consideration of some few pence every week , we were each to 
 receive a bird at christmas . my pence were duly paid , and the 
 rest is familiar to you . i am much indebted to you , sir , for a 
 scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity . " with 
 a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and 
 strode off upon his way . 

 " so much for mr. henry baker , " said holmes when he had closed the 
 door behind him . " it is quite certain that he knows nothing 
 whatever about the matter . are you hungry , watson ? " 

 " not particularly . " 

 " then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow 
 up this clue while it is still hot . " 

 " by all means . " 

 it was a bitter night , so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped 
 cravats about our throats . outside , the stars were shining coldly 
 in a cloudless sky , and the breath of the passers - by blew out 
 into smoke like so many pistol shots . our footfalls rang out 
 crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors ' quarter , 
 wimpole street , harley street , and so through wigmore street into 
 oxford street . in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at 
 the alpha inn , which is a small public - house at the corner of one 
 of the streets which runs down into holborn . holmes pushed open 
 the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from 
 the ruddy - faced , white - aproned landlord . 

 " your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese , " 
 said he . 

 " my geese ! " the man seemed surprised . 

 " yes . i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr. henry baker , 
 who was a member of your goose club . " 

 " ah ! yes , i see . but you see , sir , them 's not our geese . " 

 " indeed ! whose , then ? " 

 " well , i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden . " 

 " indeed ? i know some of them . which was it ? " 

 " breckinridge is his name . " 

 " ah ! i do n't know him . well , here 's your good health landlord , 
 and prosperity to your house . good - night . " 

 " now for mr. breckinridge , " he continued , buttoning up his coat 
 as we came out into the frosty air . " remember , watson that though 
 we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain , we 
 have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years ' penal 
 servitude unless we can establish his innocence . it is possible 
 that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt ; but , in any case , we 
 have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police , 
 and which a singular chance has placed in our hands . let us 
 follow it out to the bitter end . faces to the south , then , and 
 quick march ! " 

 we passed across holborn , down endell street , and so through a 
 zigzag of slums to covent garden market . one of the largest 
 stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it , and the proprietor 
 a horsey - looking man , with a sharp face and trim side - whiskers was 
 helping a boy to put up the shutters . 

 " good - evening . it 's a cold night , " said holmes . 

 the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my 
 companion . 

 " sold out of geese , i see , " continued holmes , pointing at the 
 bare slabs of marble . 

 " let you have five hundred to - morrow morning . " 

 " that 's no good . " 

 " well , there are some on the stall with the gas - flare . " 

 " ah , but i was recommended to you . " 

 " who by ? " 

 " the landlord of the alpha . " 

 " oh , yes ; i sent him a couple of dozen . " 

 " fine birds they were , too . now where did you get them from ? " 

 to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the 
 salesman . 

 " now , then , mister , " said he , with his head cocked and his arms 
 akimbo , " what are you driving at ? let 's have it straight , now . " 

 " it is straight enough . i should like to know who sold you the 
 geese which you supplied to the alpha . " 

 " well then , i sha n't tell you . so now ! " 

 " oh , it is a matter of no importance ; but i do n't know why you 
 should be so warm over such a trifle . " 

 " warm ! you 'd be as warm , maybe , if you were as pestered as i am . 
 when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end 
 of the business ; but it 's ' where are the geese ? ' and ' who did you 
 sell the geese to ? ' and ' what will you take for the geese ? ' one 
 would think they were the only geese in the world , to hear the 
 fuss that is made over them . " 

 " well , i have no connection with any other people who have been 
 making inquiries , " said holmes carelessly . " if you wo n't tell us 
 the bet is off , that is all . but i 'm always ready to back my 
 opinion on a matter of fowls , and i have a fiver on it that the 
 bird i ate is country bred . " 

 " well , then , you 've lost your fiver , for it 's town bred , " snapped 
 the salesman . 

 " it 's nothing of the kind . " 

 " i say it is . " 

 " i do n't believe it . " 

 " d'you think you know more about fowls than i , who have handled 
 them ever since i was a nipper ? i tell you , all those birds that 
 went to the alpha were town bred . " 

 " you 'll never persuade me to believe that . " 

 " will you bet , then ? " 

 " it 's merely taking your money , for i know that i am right . but 
 i 'll have a sovereign on with you , just to teach you not to be 
 obstinate . " 

 the salesman chuckled grimly . " bring me the books , bill , " said 
 he . 

 the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great 
 greasy - backed one , laying them out together beneath the hanging 
 lamp . 

 " now then , mr. cocksure , " said the salesman , " i thought that i 
 was out of geese , but before i finish you 'll find that there is 
 still one left in my shop . you see this little book ? " 

 " well ? " 

 " that 's the list of the folk from whom i buy . d'you see ? well , 
 then , here on this page are the country folk , and the numbers 
 after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger . 
 now , then ! you see this other page in red ink ? well , that is a 
 list of my town suppliers . now , look at that third name . just 
 read it out to me . " 

 " mrs. oakshott , 117 , brixton road--249 , " read holmes . 

 " quite so . now turn that up in the ledger . " 

 holmes turned to the page indicated . " here you are , ' mrs. 
 oakshott , 117 , brixton road , egg and poultry supplier . ' " 

 " now , then , what 's the last entry ? " 

 " ' december 22nd . twenty - four geese at 7s . 6d . ' " 

 " quite so . there you are . and underneath ? " 

 " ' sold to mr. windigate of the alpha , at 12s . ' " 

 " what have you to say now ? " 

 sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined . he drew a sovereign from 
 his pocket and threw it down upon the slab , turning away with the 
 air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words . a few yards off 
 he stopped under a lamp - post and laughed in the hearty , noiseless 
 fashion which was peculiar to him . 

 " when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ' pink ' un ' 
 protruding out of his pocket , you can always draw him by a bet , " 
 said he . " i daresay that if i had put 100 pounds down in front of 
 him , that man would not have given me such complete information 
 as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a 
 wager . well , watson , we are , i fancy , nearing the end of our 
 quest , and the only point which remains to be determined is 
 whether we should go on to this mrs. oakshott to - night , or 
 whether we should reserve it for to - morrow . it is clear from what 
 that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves 
 who are anxious about the matter , and i should-- " 

 his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke 
 out from the stall which we had just left . turning round we saw a 
 little rat - faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of 
 yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp , while 
 breckinridge , the salesman , framed in the door of his stall , was 
 shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure . 

 " i 've had enough of you and your geese , " he shouted . " i wish you 
 were all at the devil together . if you come pestering me any more 
 with your silly talk i 'll set the dog at you . you bring mrs. 
 oakshott here and i 'll answer her , but what have you to do with 
 it ? did i buy the geese off you ? " 

 " no ; but one of them was mine all the same , " whined the little 
 man . 

 " well , then , ask mrs. oakshott for it . " 

 " she told me to ask you . " 

 " well , you can ask the king of proosia , for all i care . i 've had 
 enough of it . get out of this ! " he rushed fiercely forward , and 
 the inquirer flitted away into the darkness . 

 " ha ! this may save us a visit to brixton road , " whispered holmes . 
 " come with me , and we will see what is to be made of this 
 fellow . " striding through the scattered knots of people who 
 lounged round the flaring stalls , my companion speedily overtook 
 the little man and touched him upon the shoulder . he sprang 
 round , and i could see in the gas - light that every vestige of 
 colour had been driven from his face . 

 " who are you , then ? what do you want ? " he asked in a quavering 
 voice . 

 " you will excuse me , " said holmes blandly , " but i could not help 
 overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now . 
 i think that i could be of assistance to you . " 

 " you ? who are you ? how could you know anything of the matter ? " 

 " my name is sherlock holmes . it is my business to know what other 
 people do n't know . " 

 " but you can know nothing of this ? " 

 " excuse me , i know everything of it . you are endeavouring to 
 trace some geese which were sold by mrs. oakshott , of brixton 
 road , to a salesman named breckinridge , by him in turn to mr. 
 windigate , of the alpha , and by him to his club , of which mr. 
 henry baker is a member . " 

 " oh , sir , you are the very man whom i have longed to meet , " cried 
 the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers . 
 " i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter . " 

 sherlock holmes hailed a four - wheeler which was passing . " in that 
 case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this 
 wind - swept market - place , " said he . " but pray tell me , before we 
 go farther , who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting . " 

 the man hesitated for an instant . " my name is john robinson , " he 
 answered with a sidelong glance . 

 " no , no ; the real name , " said holmes sweetly . " it is always 
 awkward doing business with an alias . " 

 a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger . " well then , " 
 said he , " my real name is james ryder . " 

 " precisely so . head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan . pray 
 step into the cab , and i shall soon be able to tell you 
 everything which you would wish to know . " 

 the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with 
 half - frightened , half - hopeful eyes , as one who is not sure 
 whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe . 
 then he stepped into the cab , and in half an hour we were back in 
 the sitting - room at baker street . nothing had been said during 
 our drive , but the high , thin breathing of our new companion , and 
 the claspings and unclaspings of his hands , spoke of the nervous 
 tension within him . 

 " here we are ! " said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room . 
 " the fire looks very seasonable in this weather . you look cold , 
 mr. ryder . pray take the basket - chair . i will just put on my 
 slippers before we settle this little matter of yours . now , then ! 
 you want to know what became of those geese ? " 

 " yes , sir . " 

 " or rather , i fancy , of that goose . it was one bird , i imagine in 
 which you were interested -- white , with a black bar across the 
 tail . " 

 ryder quivered with emotion . " oh , sir , " he cried , " can you tell 
 me where it went to ? " 

 " it came here . " 

 " here ? " 

 " yes , and a most remarkable bird it proved . i do n't wonder that 
 you should take an interest in it . it laid an egg after it was 
 dead -- the bonniest , brightest little blue egg that ever was seen . 
 i have it here in my museum . " 

 our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece 
 with his right hand . holmes unlocked his strong - box and held up 
 the blue carbuncle , which shone out like a star , with a cold , 
 brilliant , many - pointed radiance . ryder stood glaring with a 
 drawn face , uncertain whether to claim or to disown it . 

 " the game 's up , ryder , " said holmes quietly . " hold up , man , or 
 you 'll be into the fire ! give him an arm back into his chair , 
 watson . he 's not got blood enough to go in for felony with 
 impunity . give him a dash of brandy . so ! now he looks a little 
 more human . what a shrimp it is , to be sure ! "
