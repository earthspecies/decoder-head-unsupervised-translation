# Language Induction

> Exploration of unsupervised translation using fastai and pytorch


Imagine you have trained a language model (LM) to perform some task, say predict the next word or perform sentiment analysis. You freeze the model with removing one piece of information from it - the mapping from embeddings to words.

Can you create a setup in which the mapping from words to embeddings will be learnable? Something that the model could learn utilizing the information encoded in the LM? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. This repository is based on original work by Aza Raskin exploring this idea.

How well will the model be able to learn this mapping? How will it handle synonyms? Is there a way to present this task to the model to make the learning more efficient? Iterating on the original idea and answering these questions is what the experiments in this repository will center on.

The question in itself is interesting. This work can be relevant to unsupervised translation. There are also interesting and useful questions that we will be answering along the way that can benefit other areas of reasearch. For instance, what would be a [good way](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08624) to address the Linear Assignment Problem in a learnable way? Code on this and related problems will gradually be making its way into this repository as we continue to work on the main premise.
